To date, raw sequence coverage is available for >90% of the genome, and two chromosomes have been finished and annotated. Data in PlasmoDB are organized by chromosome (1-14), and can be accessed using a variety of tools for graphical and text-based browsing or downloaded in various file formats. The GUS (Genomics Unified Schema) implementation of PlasmoDB provides a multi-species genomic relational database, incorporating data from human and mouse, as well as P.falciparum. The relational schema uses a highly structured format to accommodate diverse data sets related to genomic sequence and gene expression. Tools have been designed to facilitate complex biological queries, including many that are specific to PLASMODIUM: parasites and malaria as a disease. Additional projects seek to integrate genomic information with the rich data sets now becoming available for RNA transcription, protein expression, metabolic pathways, genetic and physical mapping, antigenic and population diversity, and phylogenetic relationships with other apicomplexan parasites. The overall goal of PlasmoDB is to facilitate Internet- and CD-ROM-based access to both finished and unfinished sequence information by the global malaria research community.},

   abstract = {(1) Plasmodium falciparum malaria can be fatal, especially in young children and non-immune persons. Several drugs are effective but emergence of parasite resistance limits the choice in various parts of the world. Resistance to mefloquine and even to quinine has been reported in Southeast Asia; (2) What is the role of artemisinin derivatives (mainly artesunate and artemether) in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria? To answer this question we conducted a review of the literature, based on Prescrire's standard methodology; (3) Trials of single-agent therapy with artemisinin derivatives showed rapid clinical and parasitological effects, but relapses were frequent during the weeks following treatment. Artemisinin derivatives are therefore used in combination with other antimalarials; (4) In 2006, no parasite resistance to artemisinin derivatives has been detected in Southeast Asia after about 10 years of use; (5) In Southeast Asia, parasitological failure at 28 days was less frequent after treatment with artesunate (for 3 days) plus mefloquine than with mefloquine alone. The artemether + lumefantrine combination has similar efficacy to the artesunate + mefloquine combination. In Africa, several trials have shown that combinations based on artemisinin derivatives are more consistently effective than combinations not including artemisinin derivatives. In regions with high-level resistance to amodiaquine, one trial showed that artemether + lumefantrine was more effective than artesunate + amodiaquine; (6) The main adverse effects of artemisinin derivatives are gastrointestinal and neurological disorders, but less are rarely severe. Combinations based on artemisinin derivatives have different adverse effects, depending on the drugs used; (7) Artesunate is the artemisinin derivative most widely studied in pregnant women: in a series of more than 400 pregnancies, abnormalities were no more frequent than in the general population; (8) In practice, in regions where P. falciparum malaria is endemic, early combination therapy based on artemisinin derivatives is often recommended. For uncomplicated malaria in travellers, combination therapy based on artemisinin derivatives is one option, along with atovaquone + proguanil, quinine (less convenient) and mefloquine (frequent neuropsychological effects).},

Although the prevalence of poor quality ACAs was lower than reported elsewhere, the minority of samples found to be substandard is a cause for concern.

The limitations of the methods currently available for prognostic assessment in CLL do not allow accurate prediction of the risk of disease progression in individual patients. The recently developed cDNA array technique provides a unique opportunity to study gene expression in various malignancies. To identify new molecular markers for prognostication of CLL patients, we analyzed cDNA arrays by using hierarchical clustering and standard statistic t-test on 34 CLL patients. We found significant expression differences in 78 genes compared to the reference tonsillar B lymphocytes. A cluster of genes, LCP1, PARP, BLR1, DEK, NPM, MCL1, SLP76, STAM, HIVEP1, EVI2B, CD25, HTLF, HIVEP2, BCL2, MNDA, PBX3, EB12, TCF1, CGRP, CD14, ILB, GZMK, GPR17 and CD79B, was associated (P < 0.05) with the unfavorable 11q deletion and also with the unfavorable Binet stages B and C. We present here gene expression profiling that is associated with CLL patients with the 11q23 deletion. Many of the genes in the cluster have not previously been shown to be related to the initiation or progression of CLL. These novel findings provide fundamental information for further attempts to understand the interaction of the clustered genes in the leukomogenesis of CLL in order to better design treatments aimed at specific molecular target(s).},

Interaction of this potential transition-state analogue inhibitor with yeast orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase resulted in a small (0.6 ppm) downfield displacement of the C-5 resonance, indicating no rehybridization of the kind that might have been expected to accompany 5,6-addition of an enzyme nucleophile.

These results are consistent with a nitrogen ylide mechanism and offer no support for the intervention of covalently bound intermediates in the catalytic process.},

Medicinal plants are used to treat diseases also where the biodiversity of plants occur in parallel with endemic transmission of malaria. This review focuses on medicinal plants which are used to treat malaria in Nigeria, and on antimalarial testing of extracts and purified compounds from plants. Some show intense activity against malaria parasites in vitro and in experimentally infected mice. The search for new drugs based on plants is important due to the emergence and widespread of chloroquine-resistant and multiple drug-resistant malaria parasites, which require the development of new antimalarials. An acquaintance with antimalarial plants may be a springboard for new phytotherapies that could be affordable to treat malaria, especially among the less privileged native people living in endemic areas of the tropics, mostly at risk of this devastating disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Malaria is still a public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria causes mortality mostly in children under-five years. Early detection and prompt treatment using recommended antimalarials is key to malaria control. However, in Tanzania, contrary to the national goals, a large proportion of children with fever taken to health facilities are not tested for malaria and those tested positive are not promptly treated using recommended antimalarials. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with malaria testing and prompt use of recommended antimalarials among under-five children with fever in Tanzania. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of Tanzania HIV and Malaria Indicator Survey (THMIS) data 2011-12 obtained from a national cross sectional survey. The analysis involved children aged 6-59 months whose mothers reported they had fever two weeks preceding the survey. Factors associated with testing and uses of recommended antimalarials were obtained using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 1675 under-five children with fever, 951 (56.8%) were taken to the health facilities. Of the 951 children, only 394 (41.48%) febrile children were tested for malaria. Of those tested, 291 (78.91%) were diagnosed with malaria. Of those diagnosed with malaria, only 124 (42.68%) children used recommended antimalarials within 1st 24 hours of diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, children taken to health centers (OR 1.79; 95%CI: 1.07-3.00) and to the hospitals (OR 3.4; 95%CI: 1.75-6.77) had higher odds of being tested compared to those taken to dispensary and other lower level health facilities. Children were more likely to use recommended antimalarial promptly if they had a caretaker with secondary or higher education (OR: 4.07; 95%CI: 0.61-2.68) or living in the rural area (OR: 3.21; 95%CI: 1.09-9.44) compared to those with an uneducated caretaker or from an urban area. CONCLUSION: Training on malaria testing and treatment guidelines should be provided, and preventing stock outs of malaria testing kits and medications at dispensary level should be made available as it is the first point of health care for most Tanzanians. Reasons on why urban people are less likely to use recommended antimalarials need to be investigated and addressed for proper malaria management.},

One of the drawbacks of the hidden Markov model is that the conserved amino acids are not emphasized, but signal and noise are treated equally. For this reason, the number of estimated emission parameters is often enormous. Focusing the analysis on conserved residues only should increase the accuracy of sequence database search. RESULTS: We address this issue with a new method for efficient emission probability (EEP) estimation, in which amino acids are divided into effective and ineffective residues at each conserved alignment position. A practical study with 20 protein families demonstrated that the EEP method is capable of detecting family members from other proteins with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 99% on the average, even if the number of free emission parameters was decreased to 15% of the original. In the database search for TIM barrel sequences, EEP recognizes the family members nearly as accurately as HMMER or Blast, but the number of false positive sequences was significantly less than that obtained with the other methods.

   abstract = {The assessment of residue conservation in a multiple sequence alignment is a central issue in bioinformatics. Conserved residues and regions are used to determine structural and functional motifs or evolutionary relationships between the sequences of a multiple sequence alignment. For this reason, residue conservation is a valuable measure for database and motif search or for estimating the quality of alignments. In this paper, we present statistical methods for identifying conserved residues in multiple sequence alignments. While most earlier studies examine the positional conservation of the alignment, we focus on the detection of individual conserved residues at a position. The major advantages of multiple comparison methods originate from their ability to select conserved residues simultaneously and to consider the variability of the residue estimates. Large-scale simulations were used for the comparative analysis of the methods. Practical performance was studied by comparing the structurally and functionally important residues of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains to the assignments of the conservation indices. The applicability of the indices was also compared in three additional protein families comprising different degrees of entropy and variability in alignment positions. The results indicate that statistical multiple comparison methods are sensitive and reliable in identifying conserved residues.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment is the foundation of many important applications in bioinformatics that aim at detecting functionally important regions, predicting protein structures, building phylogenetic trees etc. Although the automatic construction of a multiple sequence alignment for a set of remotely related sequences cause a very challenging and error-prone task, many downstream analyses still rely heavily on the accuracy of the alignments. RESULTS: To address the need for an objective evaluation framework, we introduce a statistical score that assesses the quality of a given multiple sequence alignment. The quality assessment is based on counting the number of significantly conserved positions in the alignment using importance sampling method in conjunction with statistical profile analysis framework. We first evaluate a novel objective function used in the alignment quality score for measuring the positional conservation. The results for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, Ras-like proteins, peptidase M13, subtilase and beta-lactamase families demonstrate that the score can distinguish sequence patterns with different degrees of conservation. Secondly, we evaluate the quality of the alignments produced by several widely used multiple sequence alignment programs using a novel alignment quality score and a commonly used sum of pairs method. According to these results, the Mafft strategy L-INS-i outperforms the other methods, although the difference between the Probcons, TCoffee and Muscle is mostly insignificant. The novel alignment quality score provides similar results than the sum of pairs method. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the proposed statistical score is useful in assessing the quality of multiple sequence alignments.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an essential prerequisite for many sequence analysis methods and valuable tool itself for describing relationships between protein sequences. Since the success of the sequence analysis is highly dependent on the reliability of alignments, measures for assessing the quality of alignments are highly requisite. RESULTS: We present a statistical model-based alignment quality score. Unlike other quality scores, it does not require several parallel alignments for the same set of sequences or additional structural information. Our quality score is based on measuring the conservation level of reference alignments in Homstrad. Reference sequences were realigned with the Mafft, Muscle and Probcons alignment programs, and a sum-of-pairs (SP) score was used to measure the quality of the realignments. Statistical modelling of the SP score as a function of conservation level and other alignment characteristics makes it possible to predict the SP score for any global MSA. The predicted SP scores are highly correlated with the correct SP scores, when tested on the Homstrad and SABmark databases. The results are comparable to that of multiple overlap score (MOS) and better than those of normalized mean distance (NorMD) and normalized iRMSD (NiRMSD) alignment quality criteria. Furthermore, the predicted SP score is able to detect alignments with badly aligned or unrelated sequences. AVAILABILITY: The method is freely available at http://www.mtt.fi/AlignmentQuality/.},

Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with carrageenan in the left gastrocnemius muscle belly. Mechanical withdrawal threshold was tested bilaterally before and 2 weeks after carrageenan injection. After testing withdrawal thresholds at 2 weeks, rats received TENS treatment either ipsilateral or contralateral to the site of inflammation. In each of these groups, rats were randomized to control (no TENS), low frequency (4 Hz), or high frequency (100 Hz) TENS treatment. TENS was applied for 20 min at sensory intensity under light halothane anesthesia. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were re-assessed after TENS or 'no TENS' treatment. Unilateral injection of carrageenan to the gastrocnemius muscle significantly reduced the mechanical withdrawal threshold (mechanical hyperalgesia) bilaterally 2 weeks later. Either low or high frequency TENS applied to the gastrocnemius muscle ipsilateral to the site of inflammation significantly reversed mechanical hyperalgesia, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the site of inflammation. Low or high frequency TENS applied to the gastrocnemius muscle contralateral to the site of inflammation also significantly reduced mechanical hyperalgesia, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the site of inflammation. Since ipsilateral or contralateral TENS treatments were effective in reducing chronic bilateral hyperalgesia in this animal model, we suggest that TENS act through modulating descending influences from supraspinal sites such as rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM).},

   abstract = {Many proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions, which may be crucial for function, but on the other hand be related to the pathogenicity of variants. Prediction programs have been developed to detect disordered regions from sequences and used to predict the consequences of variants, although their performance for this task has not been assessed. We tested the performance of protein disorder prediction programs in detecting changes to disorder caused by amino acid substitutions. We assessed the performance of 29 protein disorder predictors and versions with 101 amino acid substitutions, whose effects have been experimentally validated. Disorder predictors detected the true positives at most with 6% success rate and true negatives with 34% rate for variants. The corresponding rates for the wild-type forms are 7% and 90%, respectively. The analysis revealed that disorder programs cannot reliably predict the effects of substitutions; consequently, the tested methods, and possibly similar programs, cannot be recommended for variant analysis without other information indicating to the relevance of disorder. These results inspired us to develop a new method, PON-Diso (http://structure.bmc.lu.se/PON-Diso), for disorder-related amino acid substitutions. With 50% success rate for independent test set and 70.5% rate in cross-validation, it outperforms the evaluated methods.},

Cyclodextrins were the most employed. Chiral additives added to the background electrolyte often facilitated separations of quinine/quinidine and cinchonine/cinchonidine diastereomers. However, in a few cases, using micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography or non aqueous CE, resolution of diastereomers could be achieved without additives.

In dilute aqueous solution, leucinal exists in unfavorable equilibrium with its covalent hydrate, whose concentration exceeds that of the free aldehyde by a factor of 40. The affinity of the enzyme for the free aldehyde is correspondingly greater than its Ki values would suggest, exceeding the apparent affinity of the substrate by a factor of about 10(6). A comparison of binding affinities suggests that L-leucinal forms an inhibitory complex analogous in structure to unstable intermediates and substrate transformation by leucine aminopeptidase, and strengthens the likelihood that this enzyme may act by a double-displacement mechanism.},

   abstract = {The phylum Apicomplexa includes many parasitic genera of medical and veterinary importance including Plasmodium (causative agent of malaria), Toxoplasma (toxoplasmosis), and Babesia (babesiosis). Most of the apicomplexan parasites possess a unique, essential organelle, the apicoplast, which is a plastid without photosynthetic ability. Although the apicoplast is considered to have evolved through secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga into the common ancestral cell of apicomplexans, its evolutionary history has been under debate until recently. The apicoplast has a genome around 30-40 kb in length. Repertoire and arrangement of the apicoplast genome-encoded genes differ among apicomplexan genera, although within the genus Plasmodium these are almost conserved. Genes in the apicoplast genome may be useful markers for Plasmodium phylogeny, because these are single copy (except for the inverted repeat region) and may have more phylogenetic signal than the mitochondrial genome that have been most commonly used for Plasmodium phylogeny. This review describes recent studies concerning the evolutionary origin of the apicoplast, presents evolutionary comparison of the primary structures of apicoplast genomes from apicomplexan parasites, and summarizes recent findings of malaria phylogeny based on apicoplast genome-encoded genes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) has been available for over two decades and has a proven record of efficacy, it is very expensive to produce and can only be made in small quantities. METHODS: In this trial, we compared the safety and immunogenicity of a new, chromatographically purified rabies vaccine (CPRV) with those of HDCV. One hundred and thirty-five healthy veterinary students were randomized in a 2:1 ratio between CPRV and HDCV respectively. Each student subsequently received an intramuscular injection of 0.5 mL of CPRV or 1mL of HDCV on days 0, 7, and 28, according to the standard preexposure regimen. Local safety data were collected for 7 days following each dose and systemic safety data for 42 days following the first dose. Vaccine administration and safety evaluation were performed by different site personnel. Sera for immunogenicity analysis were collected on days 0 (prevaccination), 28 and 42. RESULTS: All subjects achieved an antirabies antibody titer greater than or equal to the World Health Organization (WHO) accepted threshold level of seroconversion of 0.5 IU/mL after only two of three doses of vaccine in both groups. The geometric mean titers (IU/mL) in the CPRV and HDCV groups respectively were 6.54 (range 0.50 to 64.80) and 10.22 (range 0.70 to 51.40) on day 28, and 40.51 (range 5.40 to 278.00) and 37.71 (range 5.40 to 278.00) on day 42. The percentage of subjects experiencing local reactions within 3 days after any dose ranged from 65.2% to 80.9% in the CPRV group and from 77.3% to 84.4% in the HDCV group. The local reaction reported by the greatest percentage of subjects after each dose was pain/tenderness at the injection site, and most reactions were mild. Most of the reported local reactions resolved within 0 to 3 days postvaccination. Systemic reactions decreased from 76.4% after dose 1 to 36.0% after dose 3 in the CPRV group, and similarly from 55.6% to 31.8% in the HDCV group. For all postdose periods, the systemic reaction reported by the highest percentage of subjects was myalgia. No subjects experienced an immediate local or systemic reaction. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adults, vaccination with CPRV using a preexposure schedule resulted in a safety and immunogenicity profile similar to that of HDCV.},

   abstract = {Congenital ataxia and mental retardation are mainly caused by variations in the genes that affect brain development. Recent reports have shown that mutations in the CA8 gene are associated with mental retardation and ataxia in humans and ataxia in mice. The gene product, carbonic anhydrase-related protein VIII (CARP VIII), is predominantly present in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1, a calcium channel. In this study, we investigated the effects of the loss of function of CARP VIII during embryonic development in zebrafish using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against the CA8 gene. Knockdown of CA8 in zebrafish larvae resulted in a curved body axis, pericardial edema and abnormal movement patterns. Histologic examination revealed gross morphologic defects in the cerebellar region and in the muscle. Electron microscopy studies showed increased neuronal cell death in developing larvae injected with CA8 antisense morpholinos. These data suggest a pivotal role for CARP VIII during embryonic development. Furthermore, suppression of CA8 expression leads to defects in motor and coordination functions, mimicking the ataxic human phenotype. This work reveals an evolutionarily conserved function of CARP VIII in brain development and introduces a novel zebrafish model in which to investigate the mechanisms of CARP VIII-related ataxia and mental retardation in humans.},

   abstract = {Congenital ataxia and mental retardation are mainly caused by variations in the genes that affect brain development. Recent reports have shown that mutations in the CA8 gene are associated with mental retardation and ataxia in humans and ataxia in mice. The gene product, carbonic anhydrase-related protein VIII (CARP VIII), is predominantly present in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1, a calcium channel. In this study, we investigated the effects of the loss of function of CARP VIII during embryonic development in zebrafish using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against the CA8 gene. Knockdown of CA8 in zebrafish larvae resulted in a curved body axis, pericardial edema and abnormal movement patterns. Histologic examination revealed gross morphologic defects in the cerebellar region and in the muscle. Electron microscopy studies showed increased neuronal cell death in developing larvae injected with CA8 antisense morpholinos. These data suggest a pivotal role for CARP VIII during embryonic development. Furthermore, suppression of CA8 expression leads to defects in motor and coordination functions, mimicking the ataxic human phenotype. This work reveals an evolutionarily conserved function of CARP VIII in brain development and introduces a novel zebrafish model in which to investigate the mechanisms of CARP VIII-related ataxia and mental retardation in humans.},

   abstract = {The site specificity that avian Eimeria sporozoites and, to a more limited degree, other apicomplexan parasites exhibit for invasion in vivo suggests that specific interactions between the sporozoites and the target host cells may mediate the invasion process. Although sporozoite motility and structural and secreted antigens appear to provide the mechanisms for propelling the sporozoite into the host cell,there is a growing body of evidence that the host cell provides characteristics by which the sporozoites recognise and interact with the host cell as a prelude to invasion. Molecules on the surface of cells in the intestinal epithelium, that act as receptor or recognition sites for sporozoite invasion, may be included among these characteristics. The existence of receptor molecules for invasion by apicomplexan parasites was suggested by in vitro studies in which parasite invasion was inhibited in cultured cells that were treated with a variety of substances designed to selectively alter the host cell membrane. These substance included cationic compounds or molecules, enzymes that cleave specific linkages, protease inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, etc. More specific evidence for the presence of receptors was provided by the binding of parasite antigens to specific host cell surface molecules. Analyses of host cells have implicated 22, 31, and 37 kDa antigens, surface membrane glycoconjugates,conserved epitopes of host cells and sporozoites, etc., but no treatment that perturbs these putative receptors has completely inhibited invasion of the cells by parasites. Regardless of the mechanism,sporozoites of the avian Eimeria also invade the same specific sites in foreign host birds that they invade in the natural host. Thus, site specificity for invasion may be a response to characteristics of the intestine that are shared by a number of hosts rather than to a unique trait of the natural host. Protective immunity elicited against avian Eimeria species is not manifested in a total blockade of parasite invasion. In fact, the effect of immunity on invasion differs according to the eliciting species and depends upon the area of the intestine that is invaded. Immunity produced against caecal species of avian Eimeria, for example Eimeria tenella and Eimeria adenoeides, inhibits subsequent invasion by homologous or heterologous challenge species, regardless of the area of the intestine that the challenge species invade. Conversely, in birds immunised with upper intestinal species, Eimeria acervulina and Eimeria meleagrimitis, invasion by challenge species is not decreased and often is significantly increased.},

   abstract = {Sporozoites of avian Eimeria species differed markedly in their ability to invade cells in vitro. Invasion by E. tenella and E. adenoeides was significantly greater in baby hamster kidney (BHK) and chicken cecal cell (CC) cultures than in primary chicken (PCK) or turkey kidney (PTK) cell cultures. Moreover, invasion of BHK cell cultures by E. adenoeides was significantly greater than that of other Eimeria species, and invasion by E. acervulina sporozoites was significantly lower. Monoclonal antibody 1209-C2 (MAb 1209-C2) reacted by immunofluorescent labeling (IFA) with refractile bodies of sporozoites of 5 species of Eimeria and Caryospora bigenetica, but not with sporozoites of Toxoplasma gondii, Hammondia hammondi, or Cryptosporidium parvum, which have no refractile bodies. The MAb also cross-reacted with formalin-fixed BHK, CC, turkey cecal (TC) cells, and PTK. Pretreatment of BHK cells with MAb 1209-C2 significantly reduced invasion of the cells by sporozoites of E. tenella, E. acervulina, E. meleagrimitis, and C. bigenetica, but did not alter invasion by T. gondii, C. parvum, or H. hammondia. Apparently, reactivity of MAB 1209-C2 with the sporozoites was required for inhibition of invasion despite the fact that the inhibition resulted from pre-treatment of the host cell. Conversely, although MAb 1209-C2 also reacted moderately with PTK and TC cells, pre-treatment of these cell cultures with the MAb did not inhibit invasion by either MAB 1209-C2-reactive or -nonreactive parasites. Collectively, the data indicated that refractile body antigens of sporozoites of Eimeria and Caryospora, which are recognized by MAb 1209-C2, may function in cellular invasion, but also suggest that cellular invasion is probably not mediated by interactions between the conserved epitopes in sporozoites and cultured host cells that are recognized by the MAb.},

An artificial SP-HMM generated signal sequence of the maximum model bit score (HMM + 38) was selected as an ideal human signal sequence.

In this study, the mechanisms that chNKG2D T cells require to induce host immunity against ovarian tumors and which of the host immune cells are involved in tumor elimination were determined. Treatment with chNKG2D T cells led to a sustained, increased IFN-gamma production by host NK, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen and at the tumor site and this continued for many weeks after T cell injection. Tumor Ag presentation was enhanced in chNKG2D T cell-treated mice, and there were greater numbers of tumor-specific T cells at the tumor site and in draining lymph nodes after treatment with chNKG2D T cells. The increase in host cell cytokine secretion and Ag presentation was dependent on chNKG2D T cell-derived perforin, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF. Host immune mechanisms were involved in tumor elimination because inhibition of tumor growth was limited in mice that lacked perforin, IFN-gamma, NK cells, or T and B cells (Rag1(-/-)). There was no role for host-derived GM-CSF or CD1-dependent NKT cells, because mice deficient in these were able to clear tumors as well as treated wild-type B6 mice. In summary, chNKG2D T cells required both cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion as well as the participation of host immune cells for development of a host antitumor immune response and complete efficacy.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites constitute one of the most significant groups of pathogens infecting humans and animals. The liver stage sporozoites of Plasmodium spp. and tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis, respectively, use a unique mode of locomotion termed gliding motility to invade host cells and cross cell substrates. This amoeboid-like movement uses a parasite adhesin from the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) family and a set of proteins linking the extracellular adhesin, via an actin-myosin motor, to the inner membrane complex. The Plasmodium blood stage merozoite, however, does not exhibit gliding motility. Here we show that homologues of the key proteins that make up the motor complex, including the recently identified glideosome-associated proteins 45 and 50 (GAP40 and GAP50), are present in P. falciparum merozoites and appear to function in erythrocyte invasion. Furthermore, we identify a merozoite TRAP homologue, termed MTRAP, a micronemal protein that shares key features with TRAP, including a thrombospondin repeat domain, a putative rhomboid-protease cleavage site, and a cytoplasmic tail that, in vitro, binds the actin-binding protein aldolase. Analysis of other parasite genomes shows that the components of this motor complex are conserved across diverse Apicomplexan genera. Conservation of the motor complex suggests that a common molecular mechanism underlies all Apicomplexan motility, which, given its unique properties, highlights a number of novel targets for drug intervention to treat major diseases of humans and livestock.},

   abstract = {A third of patients with paraganglial tumors, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma, carry germline mutations in one of the susceptibility genes, RET, VHL, NF1, SDHAF2, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, TMEM127, and MAX. Despite increasing importance, data for long-term prognosis are scarce in pediatric presentations. The European-American-Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma-Registry, with a total of 2001 patients with confirmed paraganglial tumors, was the platform for this study. Molecular genetic and phenotypic classification and assessment of gene-specific long-term outcome with second and/or malignant paraganglial tumors and life expectancy were performed in patients diagnosed at <18 years. Of 177 eligible registrants, 80% had mutations, 49% VHL, 15% SDHB, 10% SDHD, 4% NF1, and one patient each in RET, SDHA, and SDHC. A second primary paraganglial tumor developed in 38% with increasing frequency over time, reaching 50% at 30 years after initial diagnosis. Their prevalence was associated with hereditary disease (P=0.001), particularly in VHL and SDHD mutation carriers (VHL vs others, P=0.001 and SDHD vs others, P=0.042). A total of 16 (9%) patients with hereditary disease had malignant tumors, ten at initial diagnosis and another six during follow-up. The highest prevalence was associated with SDHB (SDHB vs others, P<0.001). Eight patients died (5%), all of whom had germline mutations. Mean life expectancy was 62 years with hereditary disease. Hereditary disease and the underlying germline mutation define the long-term prognosis of pediatric patients in terms of prevalence and time of second primaries, malignant transformation, and survival. Based on these data, gene-adjusted, specific surveillance guidelines can help effective preventive medicine.},

The observed variation of Ki with pH is consistent with inhibition by this rare species.

   abstract = {Mandelate racemase (EC 5.1.2.2) catalyzes the abstraction of a proton from a carbon atom adjacent to a carboxylate function, a reaction which is kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable. Proton NMR spectroscopy and polarimetry were used to measure the rates of deuterium incorporation into the alpha-position of mandelate and the racemization of (R)-mandelate, after samples had been incubated at elevated temperatures. Using an Arrhenius plot, the value of the free energy of activation for racemization and deuterium exchange was calculated to be 34.6 (+/-0.9) kcal/mol under neutral conditions, at 25 degrees C. This result indicates that mandelate racemase produces a remarkable rate enhancement [(1.7 x 10(15))-fold], and a level of transition state affinity (Ktx = 2 x 10(-19) M), that surpasses the levels achieved by most enzymes. Methylamine, imidazole, and acetate catalyzed the nonenzymatic hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction at 170 degrees C, and the values of the second-order rate constants are 2.8 (+/-0.2) x 10(-5), 13.4 (+/-0.7) x 10(-5), and < or = 4 (+/-1) x 10(-7) M-1 s-1, respectively. By comparing wild-type mandelate racemase's proficiency as a catalyst with the proficiencies of these small molecules which correspond to the missing pieces in the variant enzymes Lys 166 Arg [Kallarakal. A. T., et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 2788-2797], His297Asn [Landro, J. A., et al. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9274-9281], and Glu317Gln [Mitra, B., et al.

These observations support the view that general acid-general base catalysis, inefficient in simple model systems, becomes an efficient mode of catalysis when structural complementarity between an enzyme and its substrate is optimized in the transition state.},

The importance of these parasites has been recognised by the European Commission and resulted in support of the COST (Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action 857 'Apicomplexan Biology in the Post-Genomic Era'. In this review we discuss the current understanding in 'Biodiversity and Population Genetics' of the major apicomplexan parasites, namely the Eimeria spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Theileria spp. and Plasmodium spp. During the past decade molecular tools for characterizing and monitoring parasite populations have been firmly established as an integral part of field studies and intervention trials. Analyses have been conducted for most apicomplexan pathogens to describe the extent of genetic diversity, infection dynamics or population structure. The underlying key question for all parasites is to understand how genetic diversity influences epidemiology and pathogenicity and its implication in therapeutic and vaccination strategies as well as disease control. Similarities in the basic biology and disease or transmission patterns among this order of parasites promote multifaceted discussions and comparison of epidemiological approaches and methodological tools. This fosters mutual learning and has the potential for cross-fertilisation of ideas and technical approaches.},

Thereby a strong dependency of signal intensity on the amount of organic solvent present in the eluent could be observed. Adding a make-up liquid (iso-propanol) post-column to the HPLC effluent greatly enhanced detection limits for early eluting compounds. Limits of detection achieved employing this approach were in the range of 7-27 mug L(-1) for the parabene test mixture and 15-87 mug L(-1) for the pharmaceuticals. In further investigations DART ionization was compared to several other widely used atmospheric pressure ionization methods with respect to signal suppression phenomena occurring in when samples with problematic matrices are analyzed. For this purpose extracts from environmental and waste water samples were selected as model matrices which were subsequently spiked with a set of six substances commonly present in personal care products as well as six pharmaceuticals at concentration levels between 100 mug L(-1) and 500 mug L(-1) corresponding to 100 ng L(-1) and 500 ng L(-1) respectively in the original sample. With ionization suppression of less than 11% for most analytes investigated, DART ionization showed similar to even somewhat superior behavior compared to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and atmospheric pressure photo ionization (APPI) for the Danube river water extract; for the more challenging matrix of the sewage plant effluent extract DART provided better results with ion suppression being less than 11% for 9 out of 12 analytes while values for APCI were lying between 20% and >90%. Electrospray ionization (ESI) was much more affected by suppression effects than DART with values between 26% and 80% for Danube river water; in combination with the sewage plant effluent matrix suppression >50% was observed for all analytes.},

   abstract = {Members of the phylum Apicomplexa are important protozoan parasites that cause some of the most serious, and in some cases, deadly diseases in humans and animals. They include species from the genus Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Eimeria, Neospora, Cryptosporidium, Babesia and Theileria. The medical, veterinary and economic impact of these pathogens on a global scale is enormous. Although chemo- and immuno-prophylactic strategies are available to control some of these parasites, they are inadequate. Currently, there is an urgent need to design new vaccines or chemotherapeutics for apicomplexan diseases. High-throughput global protein expression analyses using gel or non-gel based protein separation technologies coupled with mass spectrometry and bioinformatics provide a means to identify new drug and vaccine targets in these pathogens. Protein identification based proteomic projects in apicomplexan parasites is currently underway, with the most significant progress made in the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. More recently, preliminary two-dimensional gel electrophoresis maps of Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum tachyzoites and Eimeria tenella sporozoites, have been produced, as well as for micronemes in E. tenella. In this review, the status of proteomics in the analysis of global protein expression in apicomplexan parasites will be compared and the challenges associated with these investigations discussed.},

Motivated by the idea that the cleavage site position and the amino acid composition of the signal peptide are correlated, new features have been included as input to the neural network. This addition, combined with a thorough error-correction of a new data set, have improved the performance of the predictor significantly over SignalP version 2. In version 3, correctness of the cleavage site predictions has increased notably for all three organism groups, eukaryotes, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The accuracy of cleavage site prediction has increased in the range 6-17% over the previous version, whereas the signal peptide discrimination improvement is mainly due to the elimination of false-positive predictions, as well as the introduction of a new discrimination score for the neural network. The new method has been benchmarked against other available methods. Predictions can be made at the publicly available web server},

This process can be triggered under cellular stress conditions in order to recycle damaged organelles or provide nutrients to the cell, but may also be involved in cell remodelling during normal development. This catabolic process is conserved among most eukaryotes and characterisation of its molecular machinery has benefited greatly from functional genetic studies in yeast and mammalian models. Until recently, not much was known about the functions of autophagy in Apicomplexa, but recent data obtained in Toxoplasma have shed light on a very important role for this machinery, potentially at the crossroads between life and death decisions for the parasite. The possible roles for autophagy during the life cycles of other medically important apicomplexan parasites and the perspectives for discovering new drug targets in this pathway for combating these parasites are discussed in this review.},

   abstract = {Most Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites and many are important pathogens of human and domestic animals. For a successful cell invasion, they rely on their own motility and on a firm anchorage to their host cell, depending on the secretion of proteins and the establishment of a structure called the moving junction (MJ). The MJ moves from the apical to the posterior end of the parasite, leading to the internalization of the parasite into a parasitophorous vacuole. Based on recent data obtained in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, an emerging model emphasizes a cooperative role of secreted parasitic proteins in building the MJ and driving this crucial invasive process. More precisely, the parasite exports the microneme protein AMA1 to its own surface and the rhoptry neck RON2 protein as a receptor inserted into the host cell together with other RON partners. Ongoing and future research will certainly help refining the model by characterizing the molecular organization within the MJ and its interactions with both host and parasite cytoskeleton for anchoring of the complex.},

Crystals grow at pH 6.0 in hanging or sitting drops with either 1.6 M ammonium sulfate or 2.4-2.5 M sodium phosphate as precipitant. Both conditions produce crystals with identical morphologies and unit cell constants. The space group is P3(1)21 (or its enantiomorph P3(2)21), and the unit cell constants are a = b = 120.3 A, c = 78.4 A. The asymmetric unit is most reasonably one dimer of 66,000 Mr. The crystal size is very dependent on the supersaturation ratio, S = [initial protein concentration]/[equilibrium protein concentration], exhibiting a maximum at S = 7.7. The largest crystals diffract to at least 2.5 A and have a lifetime of 4 to 5 days in the x-ray beam at room temperature. The enzyme in these crystals is complexed with the transition state analog inhibitor 1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one (5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one riboside). We have collected data from parent crystals and from a heavy atom derivative in which the transition state analog is replaced by the active site directed inhibitor 5-(chloromercuri)cytidine.},

   abstract = {We have solved the structure of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase (CDA) complexed to the transition state analog, 5-fluoroprimidin-2-one riboside. The monomer of the alpha 2 CDA dimer is composed of a small N-terminal alpha-helical domain with no obvious connection to the active sites, and two, larger, core domains. The two core domains have nearly identical tertiary structures and are related by approximate 2-fold symmetry, but lack internal amino acid sequence homology. Comparison of the core domain structure with known structures by sequence homology and structural compatibility searches suggests that the CDA tertiary structure cannot be superimposed on any known protein structure. The two active sites per dimer are formed across the subunit interface. The N-terminal core domain provides a pyrimidine nucleoside and zinc-binding pocket and the structurally homologous C-terminal core domain in the other monomer covers this active-site cleft, completely sequestering the ligand from solvent. The deeply buried zinc-binding site is formed by a novel "topological switch point" at the amino termini of two alpha-helices in consecutive alpha-beta-alpha-beta segments. The transition state analog is bound as a covalent hydrate at C4. The inhibitor hydroxyl oxygen atom interacts both with the zinc atom and the Glu104 carboxylate group, affording high differential affinity for the hydroxyl group relative to a hydrogen atom, in a manner reminiscent of that observed in adenosine deaminase (ADA). Unlike the latter enzyme, the zinc atom is coordinated in a tetrahedral ligand field to two cysteine and one histidine ligands, plus the hydroxyl group. Moreover, the inhibitor stereochemistry is of the opposite hand from that of the corresponding ADA inhibitor at C4(R), but is the same at the hydroxyl group O4(S). A consequence of these stereochemical differences is that in CDA a single conserved carboxylate side-chain, Glu104, can provide all of the necessary proton transfer functions involved in generating the zinc hydroxide nucleophile, and protonating the pyrimidine ring nitrogen atom and leaving amino group. The differences in zinc ligands, ligand-binding stereochemistry, and tertiary structures of CDA and ADA strongly suggest that the common features of transition state stabilization arose by convergent evolution.},

   abstract = {There is an urgent need for new antimalarial drugs with novel mechanisms of action to deliver effective control and eradication programs. Parasite resistance to all existing antimalarial classes, including the artemisinins, has been reported during their clinical use. A failure to generate new antimalarials with novel mechanisms of action that circumvent the current resistance challenges will contribute to a resurgence in the disease which would represent a global health emergency. Here we present a unique generation of quinolone lead antimalarials with a dual mechanism of action against two respiratory enzymes, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Plasmodium falciparum NDH2) and cytochrome bc(1). Inhibitor specificity for the two enzymes can be controlled subtly by manipulation of the privileged quinolone core at the 2 or 3 position. Inhibitors display potent (nanomolar) activity against both parasite enzymes and against multidrug-resistant P. falciparum parasites as evidenced by rapid and selective depolarization of the parasite mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to a disruption of pyrimidine metabolism and parasite death. Several analogs also display activity against liver-stage parasites (Plasmodium cynomolgi) as well as transmission-blocking properties. Lead optimized molecules also display potent oral antimalarial activity in the Plasmodium berghei mouse malaria model associated with favorable pharmacokinetic features that are aligned with a single-dose treatment. The ease and low cost of synthesis of these inhibitors fulfill the target product profile for the generation of a potent, safe, and inexpensive drug with the potential for eventual clinical deployment in the control and eradication of falciparum malaria.},

Calcium levels are normally tightly regulated and rapid release of calcium into the cytosol activates a family of calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), which are normally characteristic of plants. CDPKs present in apicomplexans have acquired a number of unique domain structures likely reflecting their diverse functions. Calcium regulation in parasites is closely linked to signaling by cyclic nucleotides and their associated kinases. This Review summarizes the pivotal roles that calcium- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases play in unique aspects of parasite biology.},

Their generation requires cleavage of the signal sequence by signal peptidase followed by the intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease, signal peptide peptidase. In this study, we have assessed the subsequent proteolytic requirements leading to generation of the nonameric HLA-E peptide epitopes. We show that proteasome activity is required for further processing of the peptide generated by signal peptide peptidase. This constitutes the first example of capture of a naturally derived short peptide by the proteasome, producing a class I peptide ligand.},

   abstract = {Reliable structural and statistical analyses of three dimensional protein structures should be based on unbiased data. The Protein Data Bank is highly redundant, containing several entries for identical or very similar sequences. A technique was developed for clustering the known structures based on their sequences and contents of alpha- and beta-structures. First, sequences were aligned pairwise. A representative sample of sequences was then obtained by grouping similar sequences together, and selecting a typical representative from each group. The similarity significance threshold needed in the clustering method was found by analyzing similarities of random sequences. Because three dimensional structures for proteins of same structural class are generally more conserved than their sequences, the proteins were clustered also according to their contents of secondary structural elements. The results of these clusterings indicate conservation of alpha- and beta-structures even when sequence similarity is relatively low. An unbiased sample of 103 high resolution structures, representing a wide variety of proteins, was chosen based on the suggestions made by the clustering algorithm. The proteins were divided into structural classes according to their contents and ratios of secondary structural elements. Previous classifications have suffered from subjective view of secondary structures, whereas here the classification was based on backbone geometry. The concise view lead to reclassification of some structures. The representative set of structures facilitates unbiased analyses of relationships between protein sequence, function, and structure as well as of structural characteristics.},

The new method uses representatives of nuclear families as a learning set. For the sequence to be predicted, the method produces a vector of certainty factors called a fuzzy structural vector. Validation with independent test sets shows that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method has clear dependency on the representativity of the learning set. The representatives obtained from the nuclear families of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) were shown to give accurate predictions for PDB proteins, whilst the amino acid composition-based methods used previously achieve their maximum predictability with relatively limited learning sets, and they remain inaccurate even with highly representative learning sets. The usability of the new method is increased further by the fuzzy structural vectors, which substantially reduce the risk of misclassification and realistically describe vague secondary structural tendencies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The development of drugs to reduce malaria transmission is an important part of malaria eradication plans. We set out to develop and validate a combination of new screening assays for prioritization of transmission-blocking molecules. METHODS: We developed high-throughput assays for screening compounds against gametocytes, the parasite stages responsible for onward transmission to mosquitoes. An existing gametocyte parasitic lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) assay was adapted for use in 384-well plates, and a novel homogeneous immunoassay to monitor the functional transition of female gametocytes into gametes was developed. A collection of 48 marketed and experimental antimalarials was screened and subsequently tested for impact on sporogony in Anopheles mosquitoes, to directly quantify the transmission-blocking properties of antimalarials in relation to their effects on gametocyte pLDH activity or gametogenesis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The novel screening assays revealed distinct stage-specific kinetics and dynamics of drug effects. Peroxides showed the most potent transmission-blocking effects, with an intermediate speed of action and IC50 values that were 20-40-fold higher than the IC50s against the asexual stages causing clinical malaria. Finally, the novel synthetic peroxide OZ439 appeared to be a promising drug candidate as it exerted gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking effects at clinically relevant concentrations.},

   abstract = {Recombinant rabbit muscle creatine kinase (CK) was titrated with MgADP in 50 mM Bicine and 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, pH 8.3, at 30.0 degrees C by following a decrease in the protein's intrinsic fluorescence. In the presence of 50 mM NaOAc, but in the absence of added creatine or nitrate, MgADP has an apparent K(d) of 135 +/- 7 microM, and the total change in fluorescence on saturation (Delta%F) is 15.3 +/- 0.3%. Acetate was used as the anion in this experiment because it does not promote the formation of a CK.MgADP.anion.creatine transition-state analogue complex (TSAC) [Millner-White and Watts (1971) Biochem. J. 122, 727-740]. In the presence of 80 mM creatine, but no nitrate, the apparent K(d) for MgADP remains essentially unchanged at 132 +/- 10 microM, while Delta%F decreases slightly to 13.2 +/- 0.3%. In the presence of 10 mM nitrate, but no creatine, the apparent K(d) is once again essentially unchanged at 143 +/- 23 microM, but the Delta%F is markedly reduced to 4.2 +/- 0.2%. The presence of both 10 mM nitrate and 80 mM creatine during titration reduces the apparent K(d) for MgADP 10-fold to 13.7 +/- 0.7 microM, and Delta%F increases to 20.6 +/- 0.3%, strongly suggesting that the simultaneous presence of saturating levels of creatine and nitrate increases the affinity of CK for MgADP and promotes the formation of the enzyme*MgADP*nitrate*creatine TSAC. When the fluorescence of CK was titrated with MgADP in the presence of 80 mM creatine and fixed saturating concentrations of various anions, apparent K(d) values for MgADP of 132 +/- 10 microM, 25.2 +/- 1.3 microM, 18.8 +/- 0.9 microM, 13.7 +/- 0.7 microM, and 6.4 +/- 0.7 microM were observed as the anion was changed from acetate to formate to chloride to nitrate to nitrite, respectively. This is the same trend reported by Millner-White and Watts for the effectiveness of various monovalent anions in forming the CK.MgADP.anion.creatine TSAC. On titration of CK with MgADP in the presence of 80 mM creatine and various fixed concentrations of NaNO3, the apparent K(d) for MgADP decreases with increasing fixed concentrations of nitrate. A plot of the apparent K(d) for MgADP vs [NO3-] suggests a K(d) for nitrate from the TSAC of 0.39 +/- 0.07 mM. Similarly, titration with MgADP in the presence of 10 mM NaNO3 and various fixed concentrations of creatine gives a value of 0.9 +/- 0.4 mM for the dissociation of creatine from the TSAC. The data were used to calculate K(TDAC), the dissociation constant of the quaternary TSAC into its individual components, of 3 x 10(-10) M3. To our knowledge this is the first reported dissociation constant for a ternary or quaternary TSAC.},

Results with antimalarial drugs, chosen on the basis of their free therapeutic maximum concentration in plasma (C(max)), were expressed as the fold of that particular effect with respect to their C(max). The following tests were used at 37 degrees C: hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) blockade and trafficking, rabbit heart ventricular preparations, and sodium and slow potassium ion current interference (I(Na) and I(Ks), respectively). Chloroquine, halofantrine, mefloquine, and lumefantrine were tested in the hERG studies, but only chloroquine, dofetilide, lumefantrine, and the combination of artemether-lumefantrine were used in the rabbit heart ventricular preparations, hERG trafficking studies, and I(Na) and I(Ks) analyses. A proper reference was used in each test. In hERG studies, the high 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of halofantrine, which was lower than its C(max), was confirmed. All the other compounds blocked hERG, with IC(50)s ranging from 3- to 30-fold their C(max)s. In hERG trafficking studies, the facilitative effects of chloroquine at about 30-fold its C(max) were confirmed and DHA blocked it at a concentration about 300-fold its C(max). In rabbit heart ventricular preparations, dofetilide, used as a positive control, revealed a high risk of torsades de pointes, whereas chloroquine showed a medium risk. Neither DHA-PQP nor artemether-lumefantrine displayed an in vitro signal for a significant proarrhythmic risk. Only chloroquine blocked the I(Na) ion current and did so at about 30-fold its C(max). No effect on I(Ks) was detected. In conclusion, despite significant hERG blockade, DHA-PQP and artemether-lumefantrine do not appear to induce potential torsadogenic effects in vitro, affect hERG trafficking, or block sodium and slow potassium ion currents.},

   abstract = {Two experiments were conducted with a commercial turkey company using a commercial egg injection system to investigate the effect of a dextrin-iodinated casein solution injected in ovo at 25 d of incubation on turkey poult hatchability, hatch weight, and growth (6 or 7 d posthatch). In experiment 1, a total of 3,900 turkey eggs (1,300 per group) were injected at 25 d of incubation with either 200 muL of a control (physiological saline) solution or a dextrin solution (18% maltodextrin and 10% potato starch dextrin) with 75 or 375 mug/mL of iodinated casein (DexIC75 or DexIC375, where Dex and IC refer to dextrin and iodinated casein, respectively). Two hundred poults from each group were neck-tagged, weighed (hatch weight), placed in a commercial turkey house within a single brooder ring, and weighed again (7 d posthatch). In experiment 2, a total of 5,200 eggs (2,600 per group) were injected with the control or DexIC75 solution. A total of 600 poults (300 per group) were neck-tagged and hatch weights were obtained, followed by placement in a single brooder ring in a commercial house and a second weighing (6 d posthatch). Eggs in experiments 1 and 2 were obtained from hen flocks that were 33 and 5 wk into the laying cycle, respectively. In experiment 1, the DexIC75 injection resulted in a 1.8% increase (P = 0.03) in hatch weight. In experiment 2, the DexIC75 treatment resulted in a 2.4% increase in hatchability (P = 0.01), a 4.3% increase in hatch weight (P < 0.001), and a 1.8% increase in 6-d poult weights (P < 0.03) compared with controls. Results of this study indicate that a solution containing dextrin and 75 mug/mL of iodinated casein injected into turkey eggs at 25 d of incubation may be used to improve early poult weights, hatchability, or both in commercial turkey production.},

   abstract = {Most mammalian immune systems and parasites have co-evolved over the millennia, interacting within a common environment and communicating through a common language. This language is comprised of copious dialects in which a variety of host innate and acquired immune pathways actively interact with a multitude of parasite-specific survival strategies. Nonetheless, a simplified language is likely present since the same basic molecular and cellular mechanisms are associated with resistance or susceptibility to parasite infection. Protective immunity against protozoa within the phylum Apicomplexa (e.g. Cryptosporidia, Eimeria, Neospora, Plasmodia and Toxoplasma) is generally CD4+ T cell-dependent and elicited along the IL-12/IFN-gamma/iNOS effector axis. This simplified language can be decoded in part by significant advances in understanding naive T cell activation, differentiation and generation of immunologic memory. Vaccine adjuvants and new immunisation strategies for generation of more potent immunity can also be viewed through this common language lens. The aim of this paper is to summarise recently published fundamental immunology studies, their relevance through examples in specific coccidian-host immune dialects, and how this simplified language can be used for the more rationale design of parasite vaccine control strategies.},

   abstract = {Micronemes are specialised organelles, found in all apicomplexan parasites, which secrete molecules that are essential for parasite attachment to and invasion of host cells. Regions of several microneme proteins have sequence similarity to the Apple domains (A-domains) of blood coagulation factor XI (FXI) and plasma pre-kallikrein (PK). We have used mass spectrometry on a recombinant-expressed, putative A-domain from the microneme protein EtMIC5 from Eimeria tenella, to demonstrate that three intramolecular disulphide bridges are formed. These bridges are analogous to those that stabilise A-domains in FXI and PK. The data confirm that the apicomplexan domains are structural homologues of A-domains and are therefore novel members of the PAN module superfamily, which also includes the N-terminal domains of members of the plasminogen/hepatocyte growth factor family. The role of A-domains/PAN modules in apicomplexan parasites is not known, but their presence in the microneme suggests that they may be important for mediating protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions during parasite attachment and host cell invasion.},

   abstract = {The increasing spread of drug-resistant malaria strains underscores the need for new antimalarial agents with novel modes of action (MOAs). Here, we describe a compound representative of a new class of antimalarials. This molecule, ACT-213615, potently inhibits in vitro erythrocytic growth of all tested Plasmodium falciparum strains, irrespective of their drug resistance properties, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values in the low single-digit nanomolar range. Like the clinically used artemisinins, the compound equally and very rapidly affects all 3 asexual erythrocytic parasite stages. In contrast, microarray studies suggest that the MOA of ACT-213615 is different from that of the artemisinins and other known antimalarials. ACT-213615 is orally bioavailable in mice, exhibits activity in the murine Plasmodium berghei model and efficacy comparable to that of the reference drug chloroquine in the recently established P. falciparum SCID mouse model. ACT-213615 represents a new class of potent antimalarials that merits further investigation for its clinical potential.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Parasitological confirmation of malaria prior to treatment is recommended for patients of all ages, with malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) an important tool to target artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to patients with malaria. To evaluate the impact on case management practices of routine government implementation of mRDTs, we conducted large-scale health facility surveys in three regions of Tanzania before and after mRDT roll-out. METHODS: Febrile patients at randomly selected health facilities were interviewed about care received at the facility, and blood samples were collected for reference blood smears. Health facility staff were interviewed about their qualifications and availability of malaria diagnostics and drugs. RESULTS: The percentage of febrile patients tested for malaria at the facility increased from 15.8% in 2010 to 54.9% in 2012. ACTs were obtained by 65.8% of patients positive by reference blood smear in 2010 and by 50.2% in 2012 (P = 0.0675); no antimalarial was obtained by 57.8% of malaria-negative patients in 2010 and by 82.3% in 2012 (P < 0.0001). Overall, ACT use decreased (39.9-21.3%, P < 0.0001) and antibiotic use increased (31.2-48.5%, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Roll-out of mRDTs in Tanzania dramatically improved diagnostic testing for malaria and reduced overuse of ACTs for patients without parasitemia. However, post-roll-out almost 50% of febrile patients did not receive a diagnostic test, and almost 50% of patients testing positive did not receive ACTs. Stock-outs of ACTs and mRDTs were important problems. Further investigation is needed to determine reasons for not providing ACTs to patients with malaria and potential for inappropriate antibiotic use.},

Upon binding by the active site of yeast OMP decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23), the Raman stretching frequency of the nitrile group of 6-cyanouridine 5'-phosphate decreases from 2240 to 2225 cm(-1). Based on the behavior of a model compound, 6-cyano-1,3-dimethyluracil, and on vibrational calculations, the observed change in stretching frequency is attributed to desolvation of the ligand, and distortion of the ligand in which the nitrile group moves out of the plane of the pyrimidine ring. Similar distortions may play a role in substrate activation by OMP decarboxylase, contributing to the catalytic process.},

This compound, obtained by the aqueous reaction of imidazole-activated adenosine 5'-phosphate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid, is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 4.5 x 10(-9)M. Deletion of the catecholic 3-OH group of (I), in compound (II), reduced inhibitory activity by a factor of 3.5, whereas, removal of both the 3-OH and 2-OH groups, in (III), reduced inhibitory activity by a factor of approximately 2000. Acetohydroxamoyl adenylate (IV), in which the entire catechol moiety of (I) is replaced by a hydrogen atom, gave <or= 10% inhibition at 6 x 10(-4)M, indicating a reduction in affinity by more than 10(5). The binding free energy of (I) is nearly equivalent to the sum of the corresponding values for adenosine 5'-phosphate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate.},

   abstract = {Glycine undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation in dilute aqueous solution at elevated temperatures to form methylamine. During that process, we noticed the appearance of dimethylamine and trimethylamine in smaller amounts that increased gradually with time. These observations suggested the existence of disproportionation reactions of methylamines in water, for which there appears to be no direct precedent in the literature. Every member of the methylamine series is found to yield other members of the methylamine series. When the total concentration of amine was held constant and the rate of reaction was examined as a function of changing pH using the amine itself as the buffer, the initial rate of appearance of the products was found to reach a maximum when the conjugate acid and the conjugate base were present at equivalent concentrations. Near this equivalence point, the rate of reaction varied with pH as expected for a second-order reaction between the protonated and the unprotonated species. Under similar conditions, methyl groups were also found to migrate between the nitrogen atoms of N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine in a first-order process. With dimethylamine as a common acceptor, trimethylsulfonium ion was found to be approximately 104-fold more reactive than the tetramethylammonium ion at ambient temperature.},

A Bronsted plot of the observed rates of decarboxylation of these and other ionized carboxylic acids, as a function of the pKC-H values of the carbon acids generated by their decarboxylation, exhibits a betalg value of 0.7, indicating that the structures of the transition states for decarboxylation of the carboxylate forms of these acids approaches the structures of the carbanions generated by their decarboxylation. On the basis of an estimated pKC-H value for benzene in water ( approximately 43), extrapolation of that Bronsted plot leads to the prediction that benzoate decarboxylation should proceed at detectable rates in water at temperatures below the critical point. That prediction was confirmed experimentally. Using this same relationship, and extrapolating to the observed rate constant for enzymatic decarboxylation of orotidine 5'-monophosphate, we estimate that the "effective" pKa value of the 6-CH group of uridine 5'-monophosphate, the product of decarboxylation, is 9.5 at the active site of yeast OMP decarboxylase.},

   abstract = {At the active site of urease, urea undergoes nucleophilic attack by water, whereas urea decomposes in solution by elimination of ammonia so that its rate of spontaneous hydrolysis is unknown. Quantum mechanical simulations have been interpreted as indicating that urea hydrolysis is extremely slow, compared with other biological reactions proceeding spontaneously, and that urease surpasses all other enzymes in its power to enhance the rate of a reaction. We tested that possibility experimentally by examining the hydrolysis of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylurea, from which elimination cannot occur. In neutral solution at 25 degrees C, the rate constant for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of tetramethylurea is 4.2 x 10-12 s-1, which does not differ greatly from the rate constants observed for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of acetamide (5.1 x 10-11 s-1) or N,N-dimethylacetamide (1.8 x 10-11 s-1) under the same conditions. We estimate that the proficiency of urease as a catalyst, (kcat/Km)/knon, is 8 x 1017 M-1, slightly higher than the values for other metalloenzymes (carboxypeptidase b and cytidine deaminase) that catalyze the hydrolysis of similar bonds.},

   abstract = {Glutamine amidotransferase/aminodeoxychorismate synthase (GAT-ADCS) is a bifunctional enzyme involved in the synthesis of p-aminobenzoate, a central component part of folate cofactors. GAT-ADCS is found in eukaryotic organisms autonomous for folate biosynthesis, such as plants or parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa. Based on an automated screening to search for new inhibitors of folate biosynthesis, we found that rubreserine was able to inhibit the glutamine amidotransferase activity of the plant GAT-ADCS with an apparent IC(50) of about 8 muM. The growth rates of Arabidopsis thaliana, Toxoplasma gondii, and Plasmodium falciparum were inhibited by rubreserine with respective IC(50) values of 65, 20, and 1 muM. The correlation between folate biosynthesis and growth inhibition was studied with Arabidopsis and Toxoplasma. In both organisms, the folate content was decreased by 40-50% in the presence of rubreserine. In both organisms, the addition of p-aminobenzoate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in the external medium restored the growth for inhibitor concentrations up to the IC(50) value, indicating that, within this range of concentrations, rubreserine was specific for folate biosynthesis. Rubreserine appeared to be more efficient than sulfonamides, antifolate drugs known to inhibit the invasion and proliferation of T. gondii in human fibroblasts. Altogether, these results validate the use of the bifunctional GAT-ADCS as an efficient drug target in eukaryotic cells and indicate that the chemical structure of rubreserine presents interesting anti-parasitic (toxoplasmosis, malaria) potential.},

   abstract = {We have demonstrated that T3 increases the expression of ZAKI-4alpha, an endogenous calcineurin inhibitor. In this study we characterized a T3-dependent signaling cascade leading to ZAKI-4alpha expression in human skin fibroblasts. We found that T3-dependent increase in ZAKI-4alpha was greatly attenuated by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of a protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), suggesting the requirement of mTOR activation by T3. Indeed, T3 activated mTOR rapidly through S2448 phosphorylation, leading to the phosphorylation of p70(S6K), a substrate of mTOR. This mTOR activation is mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) signaling cascade because T3 induced Akt/PKB phosphorylation more rapidly than that of mTOR, and these T3-dependent phosphorylations were blocked by both PI3K inhibitors and by expression of a dominant negative PI3K (Deltap85alpha). Furthermore, the association between thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1) and PI3K-regulatory subunit p85alpha, and the inhibition of T3-induced PI3K activation and mTOR phosphorylation by a dominant negative TR (G345R) demonstrated the involvement of TR in this T3 action. The liganded TR induces the activation of PI3K and Akt/PKB, leading to the nuclear translocation of the latter, which subsequently phosphorylates nuclear mTOR. The rapid activation of PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR-p70(S6K) cascade by T3 provides a new molecular mechanism for thyroid hormone action.},

   abstract = {The binding properties of substrates and competitive inhibitors of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase are compared with those of the fragments obtained by cutting these ligands at several positions including the glycosidic bond. In contrast with the normal substrate cytidine (kcat/Km = 2.6 x 10(6) M-1 s-1), cytosine is found to serve as an extremely slow substrate (kcat/Km = 1.8 x 10(-3) M-1 s-1), despite the ability of cytosine to enter any active site that can accommodate the normal substrate cytidine. Spontaneous nonenzymatic deamination proceeds at similar rates for cytosine and cytidine at pH 7 and 25 degrees C, indicating that substituent ribose exerts little effect on the intrinsic reactivity of cytidine in solution. Dividing knon by kcat/Km, the maximal Kd value of the enzyme's complex with the altered substrate in the transition state is estimated as 6.1 x 10(-8) M for cytosine, very much higher than the value (1.2 x 10(-16) M) estimated for cytidine. The Kd value of ribofuranose, the missing substituent, is roughly 1.8 x 10(-2) M, as indicated by the Ki values of D-ribose and 1-methyl-D-ribofuranoside as competitive inhibitors. Thus, the free energy of binding of the altered substrate in the transition state is 9.5 kcal/mol more favorable for the whole molecule cytidine than for the sum of those of its parts, cytosine plus ribofuranose. As a separate molecule, however, ribose shows no detectable effect on the enzyme's activity on cytosine. Connectivity effects of similar magnitude are indicated by the equilibrium binding affinities of inhibitors. Thus, the Ki value of the transition state analogue inhibitor zebularine hydrate (1.2 x 10(-12) M) is very much lower than the combined affinities of N-ribofuranosylurea (1.6 x 10(-4) M) and allyl alcohol (0.14 M), indicating that the glycoside bond, by its presence, exerts a connectivity effect of 9.9 kcal/mol on the observed free energy of binding.},

Cytidine deaminase from B. subtilis is a tetramer of identical subunits (M(r) = 14 800). After purification from an overexpressing strain, the enzyme from B. subtilis is found to contain a single atom of zinc per enzyme subunit by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Fluorescence titration indicates that each of the four subunits contains a binding site for the transition state analogue inhibitor 5-fluoro-3,4-dihydrouridine. A region of amino acid sequence homology, containing residues that are involved in zinc coordination in the enzyme from E. coli, strongly suggests that in the enzyme from B. subtilis, zinc is coordinated by the thiolate side chains of three cysteine residues (Cys-53, Cys-86, and Cys-89) [Song, B. H., and Neuhard, J. (1989) Mol. Gen. Genet. 216, 462-468]. This pattern of zinc coordination appears to be novel for a hydrolytic enzyme, and might be expected to reduce the reactivity of the active site substantially compared with that of the enzyme from E. coli (His-102, Cys-129, and Cys-132). Instead, the B. subtilis and E. coli enzymes are found to be similar in their activities, and also in their relative binding affinities for a series of structurally related inhibitors with binding affinities that span a range of 6 orders of magnitude. In addition, the apparent pK(a) value of the active site is shifted upward by less than 1 unit. Sequence alignments, together with model building, suggest one possible mechanism of compensation.},

Comparison of pKa values of model compounds indicates that the equilibrium constant for 3,4-hydration of this inhibitor in free solution is 3.5 x 10(-4) M, so that the corrected dissociation constant of 5-fluoro-3,4-dihydrouridine from the wild-type enzyme is 3.9 x 10(-11) M. Very different behavior is observed for a mutant enzyme in which alanine replaces Glu-104 at the active site, and kcat has been reduced by a factor of 10(8). 5-[19F]Fluoropyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside is strongly fluorescent, making it possible to observe that the mutant enzyme binds this inhibitor even more tightly (Kd = 4.4 x 10(-8) M) than does the native enzyme (Kd = 1.1 x 10(-7) M). 19F-NMR indicates, however, that the E104A mutant enzyme binds the inhibitor without modification, in a form that resembles the substrate in the ground state.

A., Wolfenden, R., & Carter, C. W. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 235, 635] shows the presence of an H-bond between Glu-91 and the 3'-OH group of substituent ribose, a part of the substrate that is not directly involved in its chemical transformation. To test the contribution of this interaction to transition-state stabilization, Glu-91 was converted to alanine. The mutant enzyme is very much less active than the wild-type enzyme, with a 500-fold increase in Km and a 32-fold reduction in kcat using cytidine as substrate. No change in secondary structure is evident in the circular dichroic spectrum. As measured by kcat/Km, Glu-91 thus appears to stabilize the transition state for cytidine deamination by an overall factor of 1.7 x 10(4), equivalent to -5.8 kcal/mol in free energy. To test the contribution of this interaction in the opposite sense, the 3'-OH group of the substrate was replaced by a hydrogen atom. Comparing 3'-deoxycytidine with cytidine, the native enzyme shows a 17-fold increase in Km and a 400-fold decrease in kcat, indicating that the 3'-hydroxyl group of cytidine stabilizes the transition state for deamination by an overall factor of 6.3 x 10(3), equivalent to -5.2 kcal/mol in free energy, as measured by kcat/Km. After one binding partner has been removed, however, the effect of removing the remaining partner is relatively slight. For the mutant enzyme E91A, removal of the 3'-hydroxyl group from substrate cytidine reduces kcat/Km by a factor of only 3. Complete removal of substituent ribose reduces the wild-type enzyme's kcat/Km by a factor of more than 10(8); thus, substituent ribose, although distant from the site of chemical transformation of the substrate, contributes at least 11 kcal to the free energy of stabilization of the transition state for cytidine deamination, matching the apparent contribution to transition state binding made by the 4-OH group of the pyrimidine ring, which is at the site of substrate transformation [Frick, L., Yang, C., Marquez, V.

To test the possibility that analogous H-bonds might play a significant role in stabilizing the hydrated substrate in the transition state for deamination, we replaced Glu-104 by alanine. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the mutant enzyme's affinities for substrate cytidine and product uridine were found to have increased, whereas kcat for deamination of cytidine had been reduced by 8 orders of magnitude. By its presence, the carboxymethyl group of Glu-104 appears to minimize the activation barrier for deamination, not only by stabilizing the altered substrate in the transition state but also by destabilizing the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes. In the presence of added formate ion, but not in the presence of bulkier carboxylic acids, the low catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme was enhanced substantially.},

   abstract = {Malaria, known as the "fevers," has been treated for over three thousand years in China with extracts of plants of the genus Artemisia (including Artemisia annua, A. opiacea, and A. lancea) from which the active compound is artemisin, a sesquiterpene that is highly effective in the treatment of the disease, especially against young forms of the parasite. South American Indians in the seventeenth century already used an extract of the bark of chinchona tree, commonly named "Jesuits' powder." Its active compound was isolated in 1820 and its use spread all over the world being used as a prophylactic drug during the construction of the Madeira-Mamore railroad in the beginning of the twentieth century. During the 1920s to the 1940s, new antimalarial drugs were synthesized to increase the arsenal against this parasite. However, the parasite has presented systematic resistence to conventional antimalarial drugs, driving researchers to find new strategies to treat the disease. In the present review we discuss how Brazil treats Plasmodium-infected patients.},

Synthetase Urzymes acylate cognate tRNAs even without anticodon-binding domains, in keeping with the possibility that acceptor stem recognition preceded anticodon recognition. Representing tRNA identity elements with two bits per base, we show that the anticodon encodes the hydrophobicity of each amino acid side-chain as represented by its water-to-cyclohexane distribution coefficient, and this relationship holds true over the entire temperature range of liquid water. The acceptor stem codes preferentially for the surface area or size of each side-chain, as represented by its vapor-to-cyclohexane distribution coefficient. These orthogonal experimental properties are both necessary to account satisfactorily for the exposed surface area of amino acids in folded proteins. Moreover, the acceptor stem codes correctly for beta-branched and carboxylic acid side-chains, whereas the anticodon codes for a wider range of such properties, but not for size or beta-branching. These and other results suggest that genetic coding of 3D protein structures evolved in distinct stages, based initially on the size of the amino acid and later on its compatibility with globular folding in water.},

Tumor suppressor genes TP53 and CDKN2A were downregulated and protooncogenes JUN and GRB10 were upregulated. Furthermore, several cellular signaling pathways acting either in cell cycle regulation or in apoptosis were altered. Deregulation was found in pathways that contribute to genomic stability (by downregulation of either TP53 or CSE1L and by upregulation of GADD45A) and regulate cell cycle progression (by downregulation of CDKN2A and upregulation of RBBP4, CDC37, and NEDD5). Alterations at the transcriptional level were identified, namely, upregulation of JUN and E2F5. Abnormalities were observed in the regulation of the caspases through upregulation of CASP8 and by altered expression of BCL2-related pathway. Extrinsic apoptotic signals mediated by IGFs were deregulated and the glutathione detoxification pathway was downregulated. These findings provide insight into the regulation of balance between apoptosis and cell proliferation signals, and suggest that these genes and pathways may have an important role in the pathogenesis of AML.},

Four weeks later, each mouse was immunized with 100 micrograms fetal bovine type II collagen, and the incidence and severity of arthritis was noted at weekly intervals. AP was measured by competitive ELISA in plasma taken 5 wk and 15 wk after immunization. AP levels were less in fish oil fed males and females. Under all conditions tested AP levels of females were greater than in males. There was a negative correlation between AP levels and the severity of arthritis. We conclude from these data that although AP levels cannot be used as indices of arthritis severity, there are significant dietary and gender effects on AP concentrations as long as 15 wk after immunization with type II collagen.},

With the exception of two cases, the known mutations are clustered in the C-terminal nonhelical (NC1) domain of the collagen X.In vitro and cell culture studies have shown that the NC1 mutations result in impaired collagen X trimer assembly and secretion. In the two other cases, missense mutations that alter Gly18at the −1 position of the putative signal peptide cleavage site were identified (Ikegawa, S., Nakamura, K., Nagano, A., Haga, N., and Nakamura, Y. (1997) Hum. Mutat. 9, 131–135). To study their impact on collagen X biosynthesis using in vitrocell-free translation in the presence of microsomes, and cell transfection assays, these two mutations were created inCOL10A1 by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that translocation of the mutant pre-α1(X) chains into the microsomes is not affected, but cleavage of the signal peptide is inhibited, and the mutant chains remain anchored to the membrane of microsomes. Cell-free translation and transfection studies in cells showed that the mutant chains associate into trimers but cannot form a triple helix. The combined effect of both the lack of signal peptide cleavage and helical configuration is impaired secretion. Thus, despite the different nature of the NC1 and signal peptide mutations in collagen X, both result in impaired collagen X secretion, probably followed by intracellular retention and degradation of mutant chains, and causing the Schmid metaphyseal chandrodysplasia phenotype.},

These pathogenic protozoa replicate within an intracellular vacuole inside of infected host cells, from which they must escape to initiate a new lytic cycle. By integrating cell biological, pharmacological, and genetic approaches, we provide evidence that both Plasmodium and Toxoplasma hijack host cell calpain proteases to facilitate parasite egress. Immunodepletion or inhibition of calpain-1 in hypotonically lysed and resealed erythrocytes prevented the escape of P. falciparum parasites, which was restored by adding purified calpain-1. Similarly, efficient egress of T. gondii from mammalian fibroblasts was blocked by either small interfering RNA-mediated suppression or genetic deletion of calpain activity and could be restored by genetic complementation.},

OBJECTIVES: We systematically reviewed the evidence for such an interaction and performed a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of antimalarials among smoker versus nonsmoker patients with CLE. METHODS: Observational studies published up to March 2014 in the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were selected if they reported on the efficacy of antimalarials for treatment of CLE, according to smoking status. The strength of association between smoking and cutaneous response rate was expressed using the odds ratio. Individual study odds ratios were combined in the meta-analysis using a random effects model. RESULTS: Of 240 citations retrieved, 10 studies met inclusion criteria, for a total of 1398 patients. The pooled odds ratio for the response to antimalarials in smoker patients with CLE (n = 797) was 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.29-0.98) compared with nonsmokers (n = 601). LIMITATIONS: Subgroup analyses for the response to antimalarials considering CLE subtypes, type, and dosage of antimalarials could not be performed because of the lack of available data. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with a 2-fold decrease in the proportion of patients with CLE achieving cutaneous improvement with antimalarials. Smoking cessation should be considered in patients with CLE and refractory cutaneous involvement.},

These two advanced series were identified through a cell-based optimization devoid of target information and in this review we summarize the advantages of this approach versus a target-based optimization. Although the each lead optimization required slightly different medicinal chemistry strategies, we observed some common issues across the different the scaffolds which could be applied to other cell based lead optimization programs.},

Blood samples were taken in slaughterhouses (study 1, n=2000; study 2, n=331) and in a remote village where pigs are free roaming (study 3, n=646) and examined by ELISA using excretory/secretory (E/S) antigens. Seven samples (0.35%) in study 1 and none of the samples of study 2 were serologically positive. Thirty-seven (5.72%) village pigs tested positive by E/S ELISA in study 3. Sero-positive results by the E/S ELISA in study 1 were confirmed by ELISA using beta-tyvelose antigen, and by immunoblot. Muscle samples taken from pigs slaughtered in the abattoir (study 2) and from animals that showed a positive serology in study 3 were examined by trichinoscopy and artificial digestion. These techniques failed to demonstrate the presence of muscle larvae. The results of this survey need confirmation, but suggest that Trichinella is present in Ecuador; however, prevalence and parasite burdens are likely to be very low. The likelihood of detecting trichinellosis are higher in traditional settings than in pigs raised on improved farms.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites, including the human pathogens Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, employ specialized secretory organelles (micronemes, rhoptries, dense granules) to invade and survive within host cells. Because molecules secreted from these organelles function at the host/parasite interface, their identification is important for understanding invasion mechanisms, and central to the development of therapeutic strategies. Using a computational approach based on predicted functional domains, we have identified more than 600 candidate secretory organelle proteins in twelve apicomplexan parasites. Expression in transgenic T. gondii of eight proteins identified in silico confirms that all enter into the secretory pathway, and seven target to apical organelles associated with invasion. An in silico approach intended to identify possible host interacting proteins yields a dataset enriched in secretory/transmembrane proteins, including most of the antigens known to be engaged by apicomplexan parasites during infection. These domain pattern and projected interactome approaches significantly expand the repertoire of proteins that may be involved in host parasite interactions.},

   abstract = {Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a membrane protein present in Plasmodium species and is probably common to all apicomplexan parasites. The recent crystal structure of the complete ectoplasmic region of AMA1 from Plasmodium vivax has shown that it comprises three structural domains and that the first two domains are based on the PAN folding motif. Here, we discuss the consequences of this analysis for the three-dimensional structure of AMA1 from other Plasmodium species and other apicomplexan parasites, and for the Plasmodium paralogue MAEBL. Many polar and apolar interactions observed in the PvAMA1 crystal structure are made by residues that are invariant or highly conserved throughout all Plasmodium orthologues; a subgroup of these residues is also present in other apicomplexan orthologues and in MAEBL. These interactions presumably play a key role in defining the protein fold. Previous studies have shown that the ectoplasmic region of AMA1 must be cleaved from the parasite surface for host-cell invasion to proceed. The cleavage site in the crystal structure is not readily accessible to proteases and we discuss possible consequences of this observation. The three-dimensional distribution of polymorphic sites in PfAMA1 shows that these are all on the surface and that their positions are significantly biased to one side of the ectoplasmic region. Of particular note, a flexible segment in domain II, comprising about 40 residues and devoid of polymorphism, carries an epitope recognized by an invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibody and a T-cell epitope implicated in the human immune response to AMA1.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community health workers in Dangme-West district, Ghana, treated children aged 2-59 months with fever with either artesunate-amodiaquine (AAQ) or AAQ plus amoxicillin (AAQ + AMX) within a cluster-randomized controlled trial (registration no. TDR/UNDP Trial registration A: 20189). The intervention was introduced in a stepped-wedge manner. The aim of the study was reduction of mortality. This paper reports on the reduction of morbidity, notably anaemia, severe anaemia and severe illness. Clusters of 100 children were randomized in to AAQ, AAQ + AMX and pre-intervention arms. Six months later the pre-intervention clusters were randomized in to the AAQ and AAQ + AMX arms. METHODS: Data were collected in eight cross-sectional surveys. Using stratified sampling, 10 clusters were randomly selected per survey. Blood samples were taken to assess haemoglobin. Caregivers were interviewed about diseases (signs and symptoms) among their children in the preceding 14 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the impact on anaemia, severe anaemia and severe illness. RESULTS: Compared with the pre-intervention clusters, anaemia was reduced in the AAQ (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.12-0.33) and AAQ + AMX (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.15-0.36) clusters, severe anaemia was reduced in the AAQ (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.09-0.45) and AAQ + AMX (OR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.31) clusters and severe illness was reduced in the AAQ (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.80) and AAQ + AMX (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.22-0.63) clusters. No significant differences were found in outcome variables between the AAQ and AAQ + AMX clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Treating fever with antimalarials significantly reduced the prevalence of anaemia, severe anaemia and severe illness. We found no significant reduction in outcomes when the AAQ and AAQ+AMX clusters were compared.},

We aimed to evaluate the impact of adding an antibiotic, amoxicillin (AMX) to an antimalarial, artesunate amodiaquine (AAQ + AMX) for treating fever among children 2-59 months of age within the HMM strategy on all-cause mortality. In a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized, open trial, children 2-59 months of age with fever treated with AAQ or AAQ + AMX within HMM were compared with standard care. Mortality reduced significantly by 30% (rate ratio [RR] = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53-0.92, P = 0.011) in AAQ clusters and by 44% (RR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.41-0.76, P = 0.011) in AAQ + AMX clusters compared with control clusters. The 21% mortality reduction between AAQ and AAQ + AMX (RR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.56-1.12, P = 0.195) was however not statistically significant. Community fever management with antimalarials significantly reduces under-five mortality. Given the lower mortality trend, adding an antibiotic is more beneficial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND:Signal peptides (SPs) mediate the targeting of secretory precursor proteins to the correct subcellular compartments in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Identifying these transient peptides is crucial to the medical, food and beverage and biotechnology industries yet our understanding of these peptides remains limited. This paper examines the most common type of signal peptides cleavable by the endoprotease signal peptidase I (SPase I), and the residues flanking the cleavage sites of three groups of signal peptide sequences, namely (i) eukaryotes (Euk) (ii) Gram-positive (Gram+) bacteria, and (iii) Gram-negative (Gram-) bacteria.RESULTS:In this study, 2352 secretory peptide sequences from a variety of organisms with amino-terminal SPs are extracted from the manually curated SPdb database for analysis based on physicochemical properties such as pI, aliphatic index, GRAVY score, hydrophobicity, net charge and position-specific residue preferences. Our findings show that the three groups share several similarities in general, but they display distinctive features upon examination in terms of their amino acid compositions and frequencies, and various physico-chemical properties. Thus, analysis or prediction of their sequences should be separated and treated as distinct groups.CONCLUSION:We conclude that the peptide segment recognized by SPase I extends to the start of the mature protein to a limited extent, upon our survey of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage processing site. These flanking residues possibly influence the cleavage processing and contribute to non-canonical cleavage sites. Our findings are applicable in defining more accurate prediction tools for recognition and identification of cleavage site of SPs.},

   abstract = {Facing the explosion of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and reliably annotating their subcellular locations. Knowledge of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful hints for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. Unfortunately, it is both expensive and time-consuming to determine the localization of an uncharacterized protein in a living cell purely based on experiments. To tackle the challenge, a novel hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. The "engine" of these basic classifiers was operated by the OET-KNN (Optimized Evidence-Theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor) rule. As a demonstration, predictions were performed with the fusion classifier for proteins among the following 16 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole, (3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7) endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) lysosome, (11) mitochondria, (12) nucleus, (13) peroxisome, (14) plasma membrane, (15) plastid, and (16) vacuole. To get rid of redundancy and homology bias, none of the proteins investigated here had >/=25% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the jack-knife cross-validation test and independent dataset test were 81.6% and 83.7%, respectively, which were 46 approximately 63% higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same benchmark datasets. Also, it is clearly elucidated that the overwhelmingly high success rates obtained by the fusion classifier is by no means a trivial utilization of the GO annotations as prone to be misinterpreted because there is a huge number of proteins with given accession numbers and the corresponding GO numbers, but their subcellular locations are still unknown, and that the percentage of proteins with GO annotations indicating their subcellular components is even less than the percentage of proteins with known subcellular location annotation in the Swiss-Prot database. It is anticipated that the powerful fusion classifier may also become a very useful high throughput tool in characterizing other attributes of proteins according to their sequences, such as enzyme class, membrane protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily, among many others. A web server, called "Euk-OET-PLoc", has been designed at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/euk-oet for public to predict subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins by the fusion OET-KNN classifier.},

In view of this, an ensemble classifier, Plant-PLoc, formed by fusing many basic individual classifiers, has been developed for large-scale subcellular location prediction for plant proteins. Each of the basic classifiers was engineered by the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) rule. Plant-PLoc discriminates plant proteins among the following 11 subcellular locations: (1) cell wall, (2) chloroplast, (3) cytoplasm, (4) endoplasmic reticulum, (5) extracell, (6) mitochondrion, (7) nucleus, (8) peroxisome, (9) plasma membrane, (10) plastid, and (11) vacuole.

The overall success rate thus obtained was 32-51% higher than the rates obtained by the previous methods on the same benchmark dataset. The essence of Plant-PLoc in enhancing the prediction quality and its significance in biological applications are discussed. Plant-PLoc is accessible to public as a free web-server at: (http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/plant). Furthermore, for public convenience, results predicted by Plant-PLoc have been provided in a downloadable file at the same website for all plant protein entries in the Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations, or are annotated as being uncertain. The large-scale results will be updated twice a year to include new entries of plant proteins and reflect the continuous development of Plant-PLoc.},

   abstract = {A protein is usually classified into one of the following five structural classes: alpha, beta, alpha + beta, alpha/beta, and zeta (irregular). The structural class of a protein is correlated with its amino acid composition. However, given the amino acid composition of a protein, how may one predict its structural class? Various efforts have been made in addressing this problem. This review addresses the progress in this field, with the focus on the state of the art, which is featured by a novel prediction algorithm and a recently developed database. The novel algorithm is characterized by a covariance matrix that takes into account the coupling effect among different amino acid components of a protein. The new database was established based on the requirement that the classes should have (1) as many nonhomologous structures as possible, (2) good quality structure, and (3) typical or distinguishable features for each of the structural classes concerned. The very high success rate for both the training-set proteins and the testing-set proteins, which has been further validated by a simulated analysis and a jackknife analysis, indicates that it is possible to predict the structural class of a protein according to its amino acid composition if an ideal and complete database can be established. It also suggests that the overall fold of a protein is basically determined by its amino acid composition.},

   abstract = {The bulk hydrophobic character for the 20 natural amino acid residues, has been obtained from a database of 60 protein structures, grouped in the four structural classes alpha alpha, beta beta, alpha + beta and alpha/beta. The hydrophobicity coefficients thus obtained are compared with Ponnuswamy's original values using scales normalized to average = 0.0 and standard deviation = 1.0. Even though most of the amino acid residues do not change their hydropathic character in the different structural classes, their behaviour suggests the convenience that averaging methods should only consider proteins of the same structural class and that this information should be included in the secondary structure methods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa contain a relict prokaryotic-derived plastid called the apicoplast. This organelle is important not only for the survival of the parasite, but its unique properties make it an ideal drug target. The majority of apicoplast-associated proteins are nuclear encoded and targeted post-translationally to the organellar lumen via a bipartite signaling mechanism that requires an N-terminal signal and transit peptide (TP). Attempts to define a consensus motif that universally identifies apicoplast TPs have failed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we propose a generalized rule-based classification model to identify apicoplast-targeted proteins (ApicoTPs) that use a bipartite signaling mechanism. Given a training set specific to an organism, this model, called ApicoAP, incorporates a procedure based on a genetic algorithm to tailor a discriminating rule that exploits the known characteristics of ApicoTPs. Performance of ApicoAP is evaluated for four labeled datasets of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium yoelii, Babesia bovis, and Toxoplasma gondii proteins. ApicoAP improves the classification accuracy of the published dataset for P. falciparum to 94%, originally 90% using PlasmoAP.

   abstract = {Single oral doses of artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, arteether and artemether administered to rats during a sensitive period of organogenesis caused embryo deaths and malformations (malformed long bones and ventricular septal defects). Extended oral dosing (12 days or more) of monkeys once daily with 12 mg/kg-d artesunate also caused embryo deaths. The initial embryotoxic effect in both species was to kill primitive erythroblasts which are present in the embryo for a few days of gestation in rats and several weeks in primates. The malformations that occurred in rats are attributed to a transient depletion of the primitive erythroblasts. In monkeys, when treatment at 12 mg/kg-d was shortened to 3 or 7 days, the embryos survived but likely suffered a transient loss of primitive erythroblasts. Limited clinical data including 123 first trimester pregnancies have not indicated any adverse effects on pregnancy. However, in rats and monkeys, the embryonic erythroblasts are much more sensitive to artemisinins than are erythroblasts in the adult bone marrow; the latter are indicated by decreases in reticulocyte count. Since decreases in reticulocyte count occur at therapeutic doses in humans, there is reason for concern that any treatment of pregnant women during the putative sensitive period (from approximately postconception Day 21 to approximately postconception week 9) that causes even minor decreases in adult reticulocyte count could also cause a marked depletion of embryonic erythroblasts which could lead to death or malformation of the embryo.},

A computational method that facilitates the analysis and objective prediction of mitochondrially imported proteins has been developed. If only the amino acid sequence is considered, 75-97% of the mitochondrial proteins studied have been predicted to be imported into mitochondria. Moreover, the existence of mitochondrial-targeting sequences is predicted in 76-94% of the analyzed mitochondrial precursor proteins. As a practical application, the number of unknown yeast open reading frames that might be mitochondrial proteins has been predicted, which revealed that many of them are clustered.},

   abstract = {For pharmaceutical products, one approach developed to assure that different chromatographic systems are capable of generating valid results is the system suitability test. Typically, a system suitability test involves numerical limits for predefined chromatographic parameters such as theoretical plates, tailing factor, injector reproducibility, etc. An estimation of the ratio of signal compared to baseline is one way to measure system performance, according to a valid method, independent of the instrument. However, since this comparison relates the height of the signal to the height of the noise, it is difficult to relate to the peak area measurements that are typically used for quantification of samples. Additionally, although peak area and peak height may be highly correlated over a wide region, peak area at very low concentrations can be more sensitive to all components of noise due to peak shape. To establish a system suitability criterion, one can use the ratio of the area signal to the baseline noise for replicate injections for samples prepared at concentration equal to the limit of quantitation during the validation studies. A lower limit for this ratio can be derived using statistical tolerance intervals. This lower limit can be applied as a system suitability criterion to measure that any system is performing adequately for measuring low level components in the sample for all future use of the method.},

Transmission electron microscopy techniques have further shown that heme is redistributed from the parasite digestive vacuole to the cytoplasm and that CQ disrupts hemozoin crystal growth, resulting in mosaic boundaries in the crystals formed in the parasite. Extension of the cell fractionation study to other drugs has shown that artesunate, amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine, and quinine, all clinically important antimalarials, also inhibit hemozoin formation in the parasite cell, while the antifolate pyrimethamine and its combination with sulfadoxine do not. This study finally provides direct evidence in support of the hemozoin inhibition hypothesis for the mechanism of action of CQ and shows that other quinoline and related antimalarials inhibit cellular hemozoin formation.},

Comparison of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that culminate in accumulation of parasitised red blood cells in the microvasculature of cattle infected with Babesia bovis (babesiosis) and humans infected with Plasmodium falciparum (falciparum malaria) is particularly instructive given the striking similarities in the pathophysiology of these two important medical and veterinary diseases. While such adhesive phenomena have been studied extensively in malaria, they have received relatively little attention in babesiosis. In this review, we summarise the findings of more than 25 years of research into cellular adhesive phenomena in malaria and speculate on how this body of work can now be applied to Babesia parasites. Such information is fundamental if we are to learn more about the biology of Babesia parasites, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which they cause infection and disease and how to develop novel therapeutic strategies or vaccines for both Babesia and malaria infections.},

   abstract = {Semisynthetic artemisinin-based therapies are the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria, but next-generation synthetic drug candidates are urgently required to improve availability and respond to the emergence of artemisinin-resistant parasites. Artemisinins are embryotoxic in animal models and induce apoptosis in sensitive mammalian cells. Understanding the cytotoxic propensities of antimalarial drug candidates is crucial to their successful development and utilization. Here, we demonstrate that, similarly to the model artemisinin artesunate (ARS), a synthetic tetraoxane drug candidate (RKA182) and a trioxolane equivalent (FBEG100) induce embryotoxicity and depletion of primitive erythroblasts in a rodent model. We also show that RKA182, FBEG100 and ARS are cytotoxic toward a panel of established and primary human cell lines, with caspase-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent necrosis underlying the induction of cell death. Although the toxic effects of RKA182 and FBEG100 proceed more rapidly and are relatively less cell-selective than that of ARS, all three compounds are shown to be dependent upon heme, iron and oxidative stress for their ability to induce cell death. However, in contrast to previously studied artemisinins, the toxicity of RKA182 and FBEG100 is shown to be independent of general chemical decomposition. Although tetraoxanes and trioxolanes have shown promise as next-generation antimalarials, the data described here indicate that adverse effects associated with artemisinins, including embryotoxicity, cannot be ruled out with these novel compounds, and a full understanding of their toxicological actions will be central to the continuing design and development of safe and effective drug candidates which could prove important in the fight against malaria.},

The Human Variome Project (www.humanvariomeproject.org) was initiated to facilitate integrated and systematic collection and access to this data. This manuscript discusses how collection of such data may be facilitated through new software and strategies in the clinical genetics and diagnostic laboratory communities.},

   abstract = {Researchers and clinicians ideally need instant access to all the variation in their gene/locus of interest to efficiently conduct their research and genetic healthcare to the highest standards. Currently much key data resides in the laboratory books or patient records around the world, as there are many impediments to submitting this data. It would be ideal therefore if a semiautomated pathway was available, with a minimum of effort, to make the deidentified data publicly available for others to use. The Human Variome Project (HVP) meeting listed 96 recommendations to work toward this situation. This article is planned to initiate a strategy to enhance the collection of phenotype and genotype data from the clinician/diagnostic laboratory nexus. Thus, the aim is to develop universally applicable forms that people can use when investigating patients for each inherited disease, to assist in satisfying many of the recommendations of the HVP Meeting [Cotton et al., 2007].

These peroxides are known to react with iron or heme to produce reactive intermediates that are thought to be responsible for their antimalarial activities. This study investigated the potential interaction of selected peroxide antimalarials with oxyhemoglobin, the most abundant form of iron in the human body. The observed stability of artemisinin derivatives and 1,2,4-trioxolanes in the presence of oxyhemoglobin was in contrast to previous reports in the literature. Spectroscopic analysis of hemoglobin found it to be unstable under the conditions used for previous studies, and it appears likely that the artemisinin reactivity reported in these studies may be attributed to free heme released by protein denaturation. The stability of peroxide antimalarials with intact oxyhemoglobin, and reactivity with free heme, may explain the selective toxicity of these antimalarials toward infected, but not healthy, erythrocytes.},

These compounds failed just prior to clinical development because of suboptimal activity, poor solubility, and rapid induction of parasite resistance. Moreover, detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the THA core scaffold were lacking and SPR studies were nonexistent. To improve upon initial findings, several series of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridin-9(10H)-ones were synthesized and tested in a systematic fashion, examining each compound for antimalarial activity, solubility, and permeability. Furthermore, a select set of compounds was chosen for microsomal stability testing to identify physicochemical liabilities of the THA scaffold. Several potent compounds (EC(50) < 100 nM) were identified to be active against the clinically relevant isolates W2 and TM90-C2B while possessing good physicochemical properties and little to no cross-resistance.},

Starting from this point, we designed, synthesized and evaluated a number of thymidine analogues as antimalarials. Both 5'-urea-alpha- and beta-thymidine derivatives were moderate inhibitors of PfTMPK and furthermore showed moderate inhibition of parasite growth. The structure of several enzyme-inhibitor complexes provides a basis for improved inhibitor design. However, we found that certain 5'-urea-alpha-thymidine analogues had antimalarial activity where inhibition of PfTMPK is not the major mode of action. Optimization of this series resulted in a compound with potent antimalarial activity (EC(50) = 28 nM; CC(50) = 29 muM).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subcellular localization of a new protein sequence is very important and fruitful for understanding its function. As the number of new genomes has dramatically increased over recent years, a reliable and efficient system to predict protein subcellular location is urgently needed. RESULTS: Esub8 was developed to predict protein subcellular localizations for eukaryotic proteins based on amino acid composition. In this research, the proteins are classified into the following eight groups: chloroplast, cytoplasm, extracellular, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, mitochondria, nucleus and peroxisome. We know subcellular localization is a typical classification problem; consequently, a one-against-one (1-v-1) multi-class support vector machine was introduced to construct the classifier. Unlike previous methods, ours considers the order information of protein sequences by a different method. Our method is tested in three subcellular localization predictions for prokaryotic proteins and four subcellular localization predictions for eukaryotic proteins on Reinhardt's dataset. The results are then compared to several other methods. The total prediction accuracies of two tests are both 100% by a self-consistency test, and are 92.9% and 84.14% by the jackknife test, respectively. Esub8 also provides excellent results: the total prediction accuracies are 100% by a self-consistency test and 87% by the jackknife test. CONCLUSIONS: Our method represents a different approach for predicting protein subcellular localization and achieved a satisfactory result; furthermore, we believe Esub8 will be a useful tool for predicting protein subcellular localizations in eukaryotic organisms.},

   abstract = {Biological prediction of transcription factor binding sites and their corresponding transcription factor target genes (TFTGs) makes great contribution to understanding the gene regulatory networks. However, these approaches are based on laborious and time-consuming biological experiments. Numerous computational approaches have shown great potential to circumvent laborious biological methods. However, the majority of these algorithms provide limited performances and fail to consider the structural property of the datasets. We proposed a refined systematic computational approach for predicting TFTGs. Based on previous work done on identifying auxin response factor target genes from Arabidopsis thaliana co-expression data, we adopted a novel reverse-complementary distance-sensitive n-gram profile algorithm. This algorithm converts each upstream sub-sequence into a high-dimensional vector data point and transforms the prediction task into a classification problem using support vector machine-based classifier. Our approach showed significant improvement compared to other computational methods based on the area under curve value of the receiver operating characteristic curve using 10-fold cross validation. In addition, in the light of the highly skewed structure of the dataset, we also evaluated other metrics and their associated curves, such as precision-recall curves and cost curves, which provided highly satisfactory results.},

We used cryoelectron tomography to image cytoplasmic structures in three dimensions within intact, rapidly frozen Plasmodium sporozoites. This approach revealed microtubule walls that are extended at the luminal side by an additional 3 nm compared to microtubules of mammalian cells. Fourier analysis revealed an 8-nm longitudinal periodicity of the luminal constituent, suggesting the presence of a molecule interacting with tubulin dimers. In silico generation and analysis of microtubule models confirmed this unexpected topology. Microtubules from extracted sporozoites and Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites showed a similar density distribution, suggesting that the putative protein is conserved among Apicomplexa and serves to stabilize microtubules.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of a rapid diagnostic test for malaria (RDTm) allows accurate diagnosis at all levels of health facilities. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety of withholding antimalarials in febrile children who have a negative test result. METHODS: We conducted a prospective 2-arm longitudinal study in areas of Tanzania that are moderately and highly endemic for malaria. Children with a history of fever were managed routinely by resident clinicians of 2 health facilities, except that no antimalarials were prescribed if the RDTm result was negative. Children were followed up at home on day 7. The main outcome was the occurrence of complications in children with negative RDTm results; children with positive RDTm results were followed up for the same outcomes for indirect comparison. RESULTS: One thousand children (median age, 24 months) were recruited. Six hundred three children (60%) had a negative RDTm result. Five hundred seventy-three (97%) of these children were cured on day 7. Forty-nine (8%) of the children with negative RDTm results spontaneously visited the dispensary before day 7, compared with 10 (3%) of the children with positive RDTm results. All children who had negative initial results had negative results again when they were tested either at spontaneous attendance or on day 7 because they were not cured clinically, except for 3 who gave positive results on days 2, 4, and 7 respectively but who did not experience any complication. Four children who had negative initial results were admitted to the hospital subsequently, all with negative results for malaria tests upon admission. Two of them died, of causes other than malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Not giving antimalarial drugs in febrile children who had a negative RDTm result was safe, even in an area highly endemic for malaria. Our study provides evidence for treatment recommendations based on parasitological diagnosis in children <5 years old.},

   abstract = {Sarcocystis neurona is an apicomplexan parasite that causes severe neurological disease in horses and marine mammals. The Apicomplexa are all obligate intracellular parasites that lack purine biosynthesis pathways and rely on the host cell for their purine requirements. Hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) and adenosine kinase (AK) are key enzymes that function in two complementary purine salvage pathways in apicomplexans. Bioinformatic searches of the S. neurona genome revealed genes encoding HXGPRT, AK and all of the major purine salvage enzymes except purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Wild-type S. neurona were able to grow in the presence of mycophenolic acid (MPA) but were inhibited by 6-thioxanthine (6-TX), suggesting that the pathways involving either HXGPRT or AK are functional in this parasite. Prior work with Toxoplasma gondii demonstrated the utility of HXGPRT as a positive-negative selection marker. To enable the use of HXGPRT in S. neurona, the SnHXGPRT gene sequence was determined and a gene-targeting plasmid was transfected into S. neurona. SnHXGPRT-deficient mutants were selected with 6-TX, and single-cell clones were obtained. These SnHXG parasites were susceptible to MPA and could be complemented using the heterologous T. gondii HXGPRT gene. In summary, S. neurona possesses both purine salvage pathways described in apicomplexans, thus allowing the use of HXGPRT as a positive-negative drug selection marker in this parasite.},

We report a series of antimalarial 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidones and related N-acyl analogs 1-5, a number of which exhibit potent in vitro growth-inhibiting properties towards drug-sensitive D6 and drug-resistant C235 strains of Plasmodium falciparum as well as inhibiting the liver stage development of the malarial life cycle. The compounds 2b (IC50: 165 ng/mL), 3b (IC50: 186 ng/mL), 5c (IC50: 159 ng/mL) and 5d (IC50: 93.5 ng/mL) emerged as lead molecules that inhibit liver stage Plasmodium berghei and are significantly more potent than chloroquine (IC50: >2000 ng/mL) and mefloquine (IC50: >2000 ng/mL) in this screen. All the compounds that showed potent inhibitory activity against the P. berghei liver stage were nontoxic to human HepG2 liver cells (IC50: >2000 ng/mL). The compounds 5a and 5b exhibit comparable metabolic stability as chloroquine and mefloquine in human plasma and the most potent compound 5d demonstrated suitable permeability characteristics using the MDCK monolayer. These results emphasize the value of 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidones as novel antimalarials for further drug development.},

The repertoire of alternatives to fight malaria is being expanded, not only by designing new drugs but also by developing improved drug delivery systems able to enhance the antimalarial efficiency of conventional and new drugs. Among the new drugs that have been investigated, several publications report the use of porphyrin derivatives as antimalarials but their efficiency is contradictory. The low activity of porphyrins seems to be associated with low dispersibility and bioavailability. In this respect, Nanotechnology can provide efficient solutions to enhance bioavailability and delivery of conventional and new antimalarials, in order to assure high enough efficiency levels to inactivate the parasite. Thus, in this review we highlight the use of drug delivery systems for conventional and new antimalarials and we propose the encapsulation of porphyrins as a promising alternative for development of anti-malarial formulations.},

To solve this absorption issue, we investigated a prodrug strategy based on sulfonate derivatives of alkylamidoximes. A total of 25 sulfonates were synthesized as prodrug candidates of one bis-N-alkylamidine and of six N-substituted bis-C-alkylamidines. Their antimalarial activities were evaluated in vitro against P. falciparum and in vivo against P. vinckei in mice to define structure-activity relationships. Small alkyl substituents on the sulfonate group of both C-alkyl- and N-alkylamidines led to the best oral antimalarial activities; alkylsulfonate derivatives are chemically transformed into the corresponding alkylamidines.},

However, the function of the protein remains unknown. With the goal of establishing a model to study the mechanisms by which COMP mutations cause disease, we have analyzed synthesis and secretion of COMP in cultured chondrocytes, tendon, and ligament cells. Pentameric protein detected inside of control cells suggested that pentamerization is an intracellular process. Patient cells expressed mutant and normal RNA and secreted COMP at levels similar to controls, suggesting that abnormal pentamers are likely to be found in the extracellular matrix. Inclusions within patient cartilage stained with anti-COMP antibodies, and cultured cells presented similar inclusions, indicating that presumably abnormal COMP pentamers are less efficiently secreted than normal molecules. We conclude that the COMP disorders are likely to result from a combination of a decreased amount of COMP in the matrix and a dominant negative effect due to the presence of abnormal pentamers in cartilage.},

This retrospective study evaluated the outcome of a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine ('CVD-regimen'), which has previously been suggested for treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas. METHODS: 9 patients (5 males; age 55.0 +/- 4.0 years) with MTC were enrolled. Prior to chemotherapy, progressive disease was established in all patients by use of WHO criteria. On day 1 of each cycle, patients started with cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2), and dacarbazine 600 mg/m(2); on day 2, patients received dacarbazine alone (600 mg/m(2)). Treatment cycles were repeated at 21-day intervals and 6 cycles were planned for each patient. The standard imaging procedure was computed tomography, and the primary end point was the objective tumor response rate. After chemotherapy, patients were followed up until progression. RESULTS: 9 patients underwent a total of 57 cycles (mean 6.3 +/- 0.3 cycles). Treatment responses were: 0% complete response, 11% partial response, 56% stable disease, and 33% progressive disease. The median progression free survival was 13.6 months (range 5.8-24.2 months). The median change (baseline vs. end of treatment) of calcitonin was -19% (range -70% to +174%). Reversible myelosuppression and moderate gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSION: Although objective tumor response rates were low, the CVD regimen allowed disease stabilization for a substantial period of time and had acceptable toxicity. After initial surgery, chemotherapy may therefore be considered as a medical treatment option.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowing the submitochondria localization of a mitochondria protein is an important step to understand its function. We develop a method which is based on an extended version of pseudo-amino acid composition to predict the protein localization within mitochondria. This work goes one step further than predicting protein subcellular location. We also try to predict the membrane protein type for mitochondrial inner membrane proteins. RESULTS: By using leave-one-out cross validation, the prediction accuracy is 85.5% for inner membrane, 94.5% for matrix and 51.2% for outer membrane. The overall prediction accuracy for submitochondria location prediction is 85.2%. For proteins predicted to localize at inner membrane, the accuracy is 94.6% for membrane protein type prediction. CONCLUSION: Our method is an effective method for predicting protein submitochondria location. But even with our method or the methods at subcellular level, the prediction of protein submitochondria location is still a challenging problem.

Mice lacking tRNA(Sec) die in utero, but the in vivo role of other components involved in selenoprotein synthesis is unknown, and Sec incorporation defects have not been described in humans. Deiodinases (DIOs) are selenoproteins involved in thyroid hormone metabolism. We identified three of seven siblings with clinical evidence of abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism. Their fibroblasts showed decreased DIO2 enzymatic activity not linked to the DIO2 locus. Systematic linkage analysis of genes involved in DIO2 synthesis and degradation led to the identification of an inherited Sec incorporation defect, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in SECISBP2 (also called SBP2). An unrelated child with a similar phenotype was compound heterozygous with respect to mutations in SECISBP2. Because SBP2 is epistatic to selenoprotein synthesis, these defects had a generalized effect on selenoproteins. Incomplete loss of SBP2 function probably causes the mild phenotype.},

This decrease in kcat/Km appears to be related to diminished water content in the presence of each of these cosolvents. No agreement between cosolvents is observed if enzyme activity is plotted as a function of viscosity or dielectric constant; nor do these cosolvents act as conventional reversible inhibitors. The Km value of adenosine and the Ki values of a substrate analogue (6-dimethylaminopurine ribonucleoside) and a powerful competitive inhibitor (6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside) increase with decreasing solvent water content, but kcat is unaffected. Values of 1/Km and 1/Ki increase with roughly the 9th power of the concentration of water and show no sign of approaching a maximum value as the concentration of water approaches 55 M. These results are consistent with an equilibrium between an abundant, inactive, relatively dehydrated form of the enzyme and a rare, relatively hydrated form of the enzyme. Only the hydrated form of the enzyme, containing at least nine more water molecules than the dehydrated form, appears to be capable of binding substrates or competitive inhibitors. Possible physiological consequences of this behavior, in a tissue in which water is transported in large quantities, are considered.},

   abstract = {As benchmarks for judging the catalytic power of sulfate monoesterases, we sought to determine the rates of spontaneous hydrolysis of unactivated alkyl sulfate monoesters by S-O bond cleavage. Neopentyl sulfate proved to be unsuitable for this purpose, since it was found to undergo hydrolysis by a C-O bond cleaving mechanism with rearrangement of its carbon skeleton. Instead, we examined the temperature dependence of the spontaneous hydrolyses of aryl sulfate monoesters, which proceed by S-O cleavage. Extrapolation of a Bronsted plot [log(k(25)(N)) = (-1.81 +/- 0.09) pK(a)(LG) + (3.6 +/- 0.7)] based on the rate constants at 25 degrees C for hydrolysis of a series of sulfate monoesters to a pK(a)(LG) value of 16.1, typical of an aliphatic alcohol, yields k(25)(N) = 3 x 10(-26) s(-1). Comparison of that value with established k(cat) values of bacterial sulfatases indicates that these enzymes produce rate enhancements (k(cat)/k(uncat)) of up to 2 x 10(26)-fold for the hydrolysis of sulfate monoesters. These rate enhancements surpass by several orders of magnitude the ~10(21)-fold rate enhancements that are generated by phosphohydrolases, the most powerful biological catalysts previously known. The hydrolytic rates of phosphate and sulfate monoesters are compared directly, and the misleading impression that the two classes of ester are of similar reactivity is dispelled.},

At neutral pH, simulating physiological conditions, hydrolysis of 1 involves an intramolecular proton transfer from nitrogen to the bridging oxygen atom of the leaving group. Remarkably, this proton transfer is estimated to accelerate the decomposition of 1 by a factor of 10(11). Examination of existing kinetic data reveals that the sulfatase PaAstA catalyzes the hydrolysis of sulfamate esters with catalytic rate accelerations of ~10(4), whereas the catalytic rate acceleration generated by the enzyme for its cognate substrate is on the order of ~10(15). Rate constants for hydrolysis of a wide range of sulfuryl esters, ArOSO(2)X(-), are shown to be correlated by a two-parameter equation based on pK(a)(ArOH) and pK(a)(ArOSO2XH).},

We also aimed to investigate whether the peripheral circadian machinery may be deregulated in CLL cells. The expression of CRY1, PER1, and PER2 was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 116 CLL patients. The expression at sequential time points over a 24-h period was measured in six CLL patients and six normal donors. We confirmed the differential expression of CRY1 in ZAP-70(+)/CD38(+) and ZAP-70(-)/CD38(-) CLL samples. Subgroups formed according to CRY1 expression levels differed significantly in time to treatment. This difference was even more pronounced for subgroups stratified by a CRY1 : PER2 expression ratio and the ratio was an independent prognostic marker in a multivariate model. Furthermore, our data indicate disturbances in the periodic expression of circadian genes in CLL cells. Because of their role in the expression of cell cycle-related and DNA-damage response genes, we suggest that the deregulated expression of circadian genes may be linked to the molecular pathogenesis of CLL.},

   abstract = {Malarial parasites have evolved resistance to all previously used therapies, and recent evidence suggests emerging resistance to the first-line artemisinins. To identify antimalarials with novel mechanisms of action, we have developed a high-throughput screen targeting the apicoplast organelle of Plasmodium falciparum. Antibiotics known to interfere with this organelle, such as azithromycin, exhibit an unusual phenotype whereby the progeny of drug-treated parasites die. Our screen exploits this phenomenon by assaying for "delayed death" compounds that exhibit a higher potency after two cycles of intraerythrocytic development compared to one. We report a primary assay employing parasites with an integrated copy of a firefly luciferase reporter gene and a secondary flow cytometry-based assay using a nucleic acid stain paired with a mitochondrial vital dye. Screening of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection identified known and novel antimalarials including kitasamycin. This inexpensive macrolide, used for agricultural applications, exhibited an in vitro IC(50) in the 50 nM range, comparable to the 30 nM activity of our control drug, azithromycin. Imaging and pharmacologic studies confirmed kitasamycin action against the apicoplast, and in vivo activity was observed in a murine malaria model. These assays provide the foundation for high-throughput campaigns to identify novel chemotypes for combination therapies to treat multidrug-resistant malaria.},

   abstract = {Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS) is a rare condition with clinical features of both neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Noonan syndrome (NS). All three syndromes belong to the RASopathies, which are caused by dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. The major gene involved in NFNS is NF1, but co-occurring NF1 and PTPN11 mutations in NFNS have been reported. Knowledge about possible involvement of additional RASopathy-associated genes in NFNS is, however, very limited. We present a comprehensive clinical and molecular analysis of eight affected individuals from three unrelated families displaying features of NF1 and NFNS. The genetic etiology of the clinical phenotypes was investigated by mutation analysis, including NF1, PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, RAF1, SHOC2, SPRED1, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, and CBL. All three families harbored a heterozygous NF1 variant, where the first family had a missense variant, c.5425C>T;p.R1809C, the second family a recurrent 4bp-deletion, c.6789_6792delTTAC;p.Y2264Tfs*6, and the third family a splice-site variant, c.2991-1G>A, resulting in skipping of exon 18 and an in-frame deletion of 41 amino acids. These NF1 variants have all previously been reported in NF1 patients. Surprisingly, both c.6789_6792delTTAC and c.2991-1G>A are frequently associated with NF1, but association to NFNS has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. Our results support the notion that NFNS represents a variant of NF1, genetically distinct from NS, and is caused by mutations in NF1, some of which also cause classical NF1. Due to phenotypic overlap between NFNS and NS, we propose screening for NF1 mutations in NS patients, preferentially when cafe-au-lait spots are present.},

Using N-terminal sequence information only, it discriminates between proteins destined for the mitochondrion, the chloroplast, the secretory pathway, and "other" localizations with a success rate of 85 % (plant) or 90 % (non-plant) on redundancy-reduced test sets. From a TargetP analysis. of the recently sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes 2 and 4 and the Ensembl Homo sapiens protein set, we estimate that 10 % of all plant proteins are mitochondrial and 14 % chloroplastic, and that the abundance of secretory proteins, in both Arabidopsis and Homo, is around 10 %. TargetP also predicts cleavage sites with levels of correctly predicted,sites ranging from approximately 40 % to 50 % (chloroplastic and mitochondrial presequences) to above 70 % (secretory signal peptides). TargetP is available as a web-server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {We present a neural network based method (ChloroP) for identifying chloroplast transit peptides and their cleavage sites. Using cross-validation, 88% of the sequences in our homology reduced training set were correctly classified as transit peptides or nontransit peptides. This performance level is well above that of the publicly available chloroplast localization predictor PSORT. Cleavage sites are predicted using a scoring matrix derived by an automatic motif-finding algorithm. Approximately 60% of the known cleavage sites in our sequence collection were predicted to within +/-2 residues from the cleavage sites given in SWISS-PROT. An analysis of 715 Arabidopsis thaliana sequences from SWISS-PROT suggests that the ChloroP method should be useful for the identification of putative transit peptides in genome-wide sequence data.

   abstract = {Aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA, EC 3.5.1.26) is an essential enzyme in the degradation of asparagine-linked glycoproteins. In man, deficient activity of this enzyme leads to aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU), a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease. Here we used affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the native AGA and its denatured subunits to establish the molecular structure and intracellular location of the enzyme in normal and AGU fibroblasts. Inactivation of the enzyme was found to coincide with the dissociation of the heterodimeric enzyme complex into subunits. Although the subunits were not linked by covalent forces, the intrapolypeptide disulphide bridges were found to be essential for the normal function of AGA. AGA was localized into lysosomes in control fibroblasts by both immunofluorescence microscopy and immuno-electron microscopy, whereas in AGU cells the location of antigen was different, suggesting that, owing to the mutation, a missing disulphide bridge, most of the enzyme molecules get retarded in the cis-Golgi region and most probably face intracellular degradation.},

   abstract = {Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the recommended treatment of uncomplicated P.falciparum malaria by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Some artemisinin compounds and anti-retroviral drugs have been shown to be metabolized by CYP2B6. In the African clinical settings, the likelihood of co-administration of ACTs and antiretroviral drugs is higher than elsewhere, posing the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). This study aimed to investigate whether artemisinin compounds inhibit CYP2B6 activity in vitro using recombinant CYP2B6 (rCYP2B6) and human liver microsomes (HLM). Values for IC50 and Ki were determined by kinetic analyses using non-linear regression. In vitro to in vivo extrapolations of the likelihood of DDIs where done using a static [I]/Ki approach. Artemisinin and artemether were shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro through a partial mixed type of inhibition, while dihydroartemisinin did not inhibit the enzymatic activity. IC50 values for artemisinin were 9.5 and 9.1 microM for rCYP2B6 and HLM, respectively, after 30 min of incubation. Corresponding values for artemether were 7.5 and 5.4 microM. Artemisinin did not show any time-dependency or requirement of NADPH in its mechanism, indicating a reversible mode of inhibition. Based on the [I]/Ki approach using rCYP2B6, the risk of DDIs for artemisinin was indicated to be medium to high, while artemether had a low risk. The findings indicate a potential but moderate risk of DDIs in the co-administration of artemisinin or artemether with efavirenz in the co-treatment of malaria and HIV/AIDS.},

Inhibitory potency (IC50) and mechanisms of inhibition were evaluated using nonlinear regression analysis. In vitro-in vivo extrapolation using the [I]/Ki ratio was applied to predict the risk of DDI in vivo. 3. All compounds tested inhibited the enzymatic activity of CYPs, mostly through a mixed type of inhibition, with CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C19 and 3A4 being affected. A high risk of interaction in vivo was predicted if artemisinin is coadministrated with CYP1A2 or 2C19 substrates. 4. With respect to CYP1A2 inhibition in vivo by artemisinin compounds, our findings are in line with previously published data. However, reported risks of interaction may be overpredicted and should be interpreted with caution.},

The results suggest that nucleophilic addition by the enzyme at the 5,6 position of the substrate is not an essential part of catalysis, unless the active site is so flexible that deamination can occur with addition in one case (cytidine) and without addition in another case (5,6-dihydrocytidine). 3,4,5,6-Tetrahydrouridine bears a close structural resemblance to a hypothetical "tetrahedral" intermediate formed by direct water addition to 5,6-dihydrocytidine. The hydrolytic activity of the enzyme toward 5,6-dihydrocytidine and its potent inhibition by 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine are presumably related by the ability of the active site to stabilize structures of this kind by tight binding. Cytidine deaminase shows no detectable activity as a catalyst for the dehydration of 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrouridine.},

However, due to the large number of reported drugs and drug combinations, detecting ADE signals by mining these reports is becoming a challenging task in terms of computational complexity. Recently, a parallel programming model, MapReduce has been introduced by Google to support large-scale data intensive applications. In this study, we proposed a MapReduce-based algorithm, for common ADE detection approach, Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), and tested it in mining spontaneous ADE reports from FDA. The purpose is to investigate the possibility of using MapReduce principle to speed up biomedical data mining tasks using this pharmacovigilance case as one specific example. The results demonstrated that MapReduce programming model could improve the performance of common signal detection algorithm for pharmacovigilance in a distributed computation environment at approximately liner speedup rates.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disturbed cellular cholesterol homeostasis may lead to accumulation of cholesterol in human atheroma plaques. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is controlled by the sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF-2) and the SREBF cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). We investigated whole genome expression in a series of human atherosclerotic samples from different vascular territories and studied whether the non-synonymous coding variants in the interacting domains of two genes, SREBF-2 1784G>C (rs2228314) and SCAP 2386A>G, are related to the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the risk of pre-hospital sudden cardiac death (SCD). METHODS: Whole genome expression profiling was completed in twenty vascular samples from carotid, aortic and femoral atherosclerotic plaques and six control samples from internal mammary arteries. Three hundred sudden pre-hospital deaths of middle-aged (33-69 years) Caucasian Finnish men were subjected to detailed autopsy in the Helsinki Sudden Death Study. Coronary narrowing and areas of coronary wall covered with fatty streaks or fibrotic, calcified or complicated lesions were measured and related to the SREBF-2 and SCAP genotypes. RESULTS: Whole genome expression profiling showed a significant (p = 0.02) down-regulation of SREBF-2 in atherosclerotic carotid plaques (types IV-V), but not in the aorta or femoral arteries (p = NS for both), as compared with the histologically confirmed non-atherosclerotic tissues. In logistic regression analysis, a significant interaction between the SREBF-2 1784G>C and the SCAP 2386A>G genotype was observed on the risk of SCD (p = 0.046). Men with the SREBF-2 C allele and the SCAP G allele had a significantly increased risk of SCD (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.07-6.71), compared to SCAP AA homologous subjects carrying the SREBF-2 C allele. Furthermore, similar trends for having complicated lesions and for the occurrence of thrombosis were found, although the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the allelic variants (SREBF-2 1784G>C and SCAP 2386A>G) in the cholesterol homeostasis regulating SREBF-SCAP pathway may contribute to SCD in early middle-aged men.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is regarded as a potential biomarker in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The relations between aberrant gene methylation and cancer development have been identified by a number of recent scientific studies. In a previous work, we used co-occurrences to mine those associations and compiled the MeInfoText 1.0 database. To reduce the amount of manual curation and improve the accuracy of relation extraction, we have now developed MeInfoText 2.0, which uses a machine learning-based approach to extract gene methylation-cancer relations. DESCRIPTION: Two maximum entropy models are trained to predict if aberrant gene methylation is related to any type of cancer mentioned in the literature. After evaluation based on 10-fold cross-validation, the average precision/recall rates of the two models are 94.7/90.1 and 91.8/90% respectively. MeInfoText 2.0 provides the gene methylation profiles of different types of human cancer. The extracted relations with maximum probability, evidence sentences, and specific gene information are also retrievable. The database is available at http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw:8081/MeInfoText2/. CONCLUSION: The previous version, MeInfoText, was developed by using association rules, whereas MeInfoText 2.0 is based on a new framework that combines machine learning, dictionary lookup and pattern matching for epigenetics information extraction. The results of experiments show that MeInfoText 2.0 outperforms existing tools in many respects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a hybrid approach to extract gene methylation-cancer relations. It is also the first attempt to develop a gene methylation and cancer relation corpus.},

This molecule also encodes mitochondrial rRNAs as small fragments in scattered locations. Despite their unusual nature, evidence suggests that these rRNAs are functional. They offer an opportunity to evaluate structure-function correlations in the absence of much of the more variable sequences found in other rRNAs. The second extrachromosomal DNA has characteristics reminiscent of chloroplast DNAs and thus points to an unexpected ancestry for the apicomplexans. Both DNAs are inherited maternally, as is usual for organelle DNAs, but their subcellular locations have not been demonstrated unequivocally. Although the majority of studies with these two DNAs thus far have been with Plasmodium species, evidence from other apicomplexans suggests that these unusual organelle genomes are common to the phylum.},

These in turn produce mediator molecules which maintain HLA class II expression (and hence antigen-presenting capacity) in the target tissues; and also initiate the immune and inflammatory pathways. The importance of this concept is that it provides a readily testable hypothesis that has been investigated extensively. For the thyroid diseases compelling data to support it have accumulated; in other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis the evidence is increasing. The concept also relates the human autoimmune diseases to the normal mechanisms of immune induction and immunoregulation. This highlights the areas that we do not yet understand, namely the interplay of genetic susceptibility, extrinsic agents or disorders of immune regulation which permit the autoimmune process to become sufficiently pronounced as to engender a clinical autoimmune disease. Even with our limited understanding of the disease process, it is apparent that there are many opportunities for newer approaches at therapy, based on interfering with the immune cells or their mediators.},

   abstract = {The present paper overviews the issue on predicting the subcellular location of a protein. Five measures of extracting information from the global sequence based on the Bayes discriminant algorithm are reviewed. 1) The auto-correlation functions of amino acid indices along the sequence; 2) The quasi-sequence-order approach; 3) the pseudo-amino acid composition; 4) the unified attribute vector in Hilbert space, 5) Zp parameters extracted from the Zp curve. The actual performance of the predictive accuracy is closely related to the degree of similarity between the training and testing sets or to the average degree of pairwise similarity in dataset in a cross-validated study. Many scholars considered that the current higher predictive accuracy still cannot ensure that some available algorithms are effective in practice prediction for the higher pairwise sequence identity of the datasets, but some of them declared that construction of the dataset used for developing software should base on the reality determined by the Mother Nature that some subcellular locations really contain only a minor number of proteins of which some even have a high percentage of sequence similarity. Owing to the complexity of the problem itself, some very sophisticated and special programs are needed for both constructing dataset and improving the prediction. Anyhow finding the target information in mature protein sequence and properly cooperating it with sorting signals in prediction may further improve the overall predictive accuracy and make the prediction into practice.},

The isolates came from the region of Uraba in Colombia, in which malaria is endemic, and were evaluated by the schizont maturation test. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.6 nM (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3 to 1.0 nM) for artesunate, 8.5 nM (95% CI, 5.6 to 13.0 nM) for amodiaquine, 23.3 nM (95% CI, 12.4 to 44.1 nM) for chloroquine, 55.6 nM (95% CI, 36.8 to 84.1 nM) for mefloquine, and 115.3 nM (95% CI, 57.7 to 230.5 nM) for quinine. The isolates were classified according to whether the initial parasites were mature or immature trophozoites (Tfz). It was found that the IC50s for chloroquine and artesunate were significantly different in the two aforementioned groups (P < 0.001). The IC50s of CQ and AS were higher in the isolates from mature Tfz (CQ, 39.3 nM versus 17 nM; AS, 1.4 nM versus 0.3 nM), and 10% of the isolates showed lower susceptibilities to one of the antimalarial drugs, 13.3% to two antimalarial drugs, and 3.3% to more than three antimalarial drugs. It should be highlighted that despite the extensive use of chloroquine in Colombia, P. vivax continues to be susceptible to antimalarials.

Several monoclonal antibodies against CSP have been generated to date, with some of them mediating antimalarial protection upon passive transfer into animals. Genetically engineered transgenic mosquitoes producing the anti-CSP antibody have recently been generated to reduce malarial transmission. A monoclonal anti-CSP antibody was produced in mice by adeno-associated virus vector, which protected them from malaria. Phase III trials with RTS,S vaccine that targets CSP of Plasmodium falciparum have shown modest efficacy. Polyclonal anti-CSP antibodies derived from children who received the RTS,S vaccine failed to block malarial transmission through mosquitoes, but passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies raised from RTS,S-vaccinated recipient conferred protection against malaria in mice. Taken together, these findings may imply CSP as an antimalarial target.},

   abstract = {Context: Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), a protein secreted by the liver, is the main thyroid hormone (TH) transporter in human serum. TBG deficiency is characterized by reduced serum TH levels, but normal free TH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and absent clinical manifestations. The inherited form of TBG deficiency is usually due to a mutation in the TBG gene located on the X-chromosome. Objective: Of 75 families with X-chromosome linked TBG deficiency identified in our laboratory, no mutations in the TBG gene were found in 4 families. The aim of the study was to identify the mechanism of TBG deficiency in these four families using biochemical and genetic studies. Design: Observational cohort, prospective. Setting: University Research Center. Patients: Four families with inherited TBG deficiency and no mutations in the TBG gene. Intervention: Clinical evaluation, thyroid function tests and targeted re-sequencing of 1Mb of the X-chromosome. Results: Next generation sequencing identified a novel G to A variant 20kb downstream of the TBG gene in all 4 families. In silico analysis predicted that the variant resides within a liver-specific enhancer. In vitro studies confirmed the enhancer activity of a 2.2kb fragment of genomic DNA containing the novel variant and showed that the mutation reduces the activity of this enhancer. The affected subjects share a haplotype of 8Mb surrounding the mutation and the most recent common ancestor among the four families was estimated to be 19.5 generations ago [95% confidence intervals: 10.4-37]. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of an inherited endocrine disorder caused by a mutation in an enhancer region.},

   abstract = {The mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IgVH) has been found to be a good prognostic indicator for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) because unmutated VH genes are associated with rapid disease progression and shorter survival time. To study the differences in gene expression between the Ig-unmutated and Ig-mutated CLL subtypes, we performed gene expression profiling on 31 CLL cases and investigated the VH gene mutation status by sequencing. The array data showed that the greatest variances between the unmutated (20 cases) and the mutated (11 cases) group were in expressions of ZAP70, RAF1, PAX5, TCF1, CD44, SF1, S100A12, NUP214, DAF, GLVR1, MKK6, AF4, CX3CR1, NAFTC1, and HEX. ZAP70 was significantly more expressed in the Ig-unmutated CLL group, whereas the expression of all the other genes was higher in the Ig-mutated cases. These results corroborate a recent finding, according to which the expression of ZAP70 can predict the VH mutation status and suggest that RAF1, PAX5, and other differentially expressed genes may offer good markers for differentiating unmutated cases from mutated cases and thus serve as prognostic markers.},

   abstract = {Animals display a repertoire of different social behaviours. Appropriate behavioural responses depend on sensory input received during social interactions. In mice, social behaviour is driven by pheromones, chemical signals that encode information related to age, sex and physiological state. However, although mice show different social behaviours towards adults, juveniles and neonates, sensory cues that enable specific recognition of juvenile mice are unknown. Here we describe a juvenile pheromone produced by young mice before puberty, termed exocrine-gland secreting peptide 22 (ESP22). ESP22 is secreted from the lacrimal gland and released into tears of 2- to 3-week-old mice. Upon detection, ESP22 activates high-affinity sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ, and downstream limbic neurons in the medial amygdala. Recombinant ESP22, painted on mice, exerts a powerful inhibitory effect on adult male mating behaviour, which is abolished in knockout mice lacking TRPC2, a key signalling component of the vomeronasal organ. Furthermore, knockout of TRPC2 or loss of ESP22 production results in increased sexual behaviour of adult males towards juveniles, and sexual responses towards ESP22-deficient juveniles are suppressed by ESP22 painting. Thus, we describe a pheromone of sexually immature mice that controls an innate social behaviour, a response pathway through the accessory olfactory system and a new role for vomeronasal organ signalling in inhibiting sexual behaviour towards young. These findings provide a molecular framework for understanding how a sensory system can regulate behaviour.},

   abstract = {rECH1, a recently identified rat cDNA (FitzPatrick, D. R., Germain-Lee, E., and Valle, D. (1995) Genomics 27, 457-466) encodes a polypeptide belonging to the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. We modeled the structure of rECH1 based on rat mitochondrial 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1. The model predicts that rECH1p has the hydratase fold in the core domain and two domains for interaction with other subunits. When we incubated 3,5,8,11, 14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA with purified rECH1p, the spectral data suggested a switching of the double bonds from the Delta3-Delta5 to the Delta2-Delta4 positions. This was confirmed by demonstrating that the product was a valid substrate for 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. These results indicate that rECH1p is Delta3,5-Delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to a synthetic polypeptide derived from the C terminus of rECH1p showed that rECH1p is located in the matrix of both mitochondria and peroxisomes in rat liver. Consistent with these observations, the 36,000-Da rECH1p has a potential N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal as well as a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal type 1. Transport of the protein into the mitochondria with cleavage of the targeting signal results in a mature mitochondrial form with a molecular mass of 32,000 Da; transport to peroxisomes yields a protein of 36,000 Da.},

Whole genome sequencing of three resistant lines showed that each had acquired independent mutations in a P-type cation-transporter ATPase, PfATP4 (PF3D7_1211900), a protein implicated as the novel Plasmodium spp. target of another, structurally unrelated, class of antimalarials called the spiroindolones and characterized as an important sodium transporter of the cell. Similarly to the spiroindolones, GNF-Pf4492 blocks parasite transmission to mosquitoes and disrupts intracellular sodium homeostasis. Our data demonstrate that PfATP4 plays a critical role in cellular processes, can be inhibited by two distinct antimalarial pharmacophores, and supports the recent observations that PfATP4 is a critical antimalarial target.},

In some mitochondria and derived anaerobic organelles, a few or all of these respiratory complexes have been lost during evolution. We show that the respiratory chain of Chromera velia, a phototrophic relative of parasitic apicomplexans, lacks complexes I and III, making it a uniquely reduced aerobic mitochondrion. In Chromera, putative lactate:cytochrome c oxidoreductases are predicted to transfer electrons from lactate to cytochrome c, rendering complex III unnecessary. The mitochondrial genome of Chromera has the smallest known protein-coding capacity of all mitochondria, encoding just cox1 and cox3 on heterogeneous linear molecules.

Important components of the molecular machinery that orchestrates OSN Ca(2+) dynamics have been described, but key details are still missing. Here, we demonstrate a critical physiological role of mitochondrial Ca(2+) mobilization in mouse OSNs. Combining a new mitochondrial Ca(2+) imaging approach with patch-clamp recordings, organelle mobility assays and ultrastructural analyses, our study identifies mitochondria as key determinants of olfactory signaling. We show that mitochondrial Ca(2+) mobilization during sensory stimulation shapes the cytosolic Ca(2+) response profile in OSNs, ensures a broad dynamic response range and maintains sensitivity of the spike generation machinery. When mitochondrial function is impaired, olfactory neurons function as simple stimulus detectors rather than as intensity encoders. Moreover, we describe activity-dependent recruitment of mitochondria to olfactory knobs, a mechanism that provides a context-dependent tool for OSNs to maintain cellular homeostasis and signaling integrity.},

We have previously explored the effect of these mutations by engineering homologous alleles of Toxoplasma gondii DHFR-TS, which can readily be expressed as recombinant protein for enzymatic studies, or as allelic replacements in transgenic parasites. In order to directly assess the costs of pyrimethamine-resistance in vivo, we have carried out competition studies between mixtures of T. gondii tachyzoites harbouring wild-type or mutant DHFR-TS alleles, both in tissue culture and in mice. Arg59+Asn108 mutants (using the P. falciparum numbering system) exhibit no significant fitness defects in vitro, but a fitness defect of 1.8% per generation in mice. Arg59+Ser223 mutants exhibit fitness defects of >2.8% per generation both in vitro and in vivo, which may explain why this highly pyrimethamine-resistant allele has not been observed in the field. It is important to note that long-term propagation of parasites in vitro or in vivo can produce adaptations affecting fitness by >3.7% per generation, necessitating careful attention to background in head-to-head competition studies. A sensitive PCR-based assay permits different growth rates to be assessed even in the absence of a drug resistance marker that can be scored by plaque assay.},

These parasites contain a relict plastid-termed "apicoplast"--that originated from the engulfment of an organism of the red algal lineage. The apicoplast is indispensable but its exact role in parasites is unknown. The apicoplast has its own genome and expresses a small number of genes, but the vast majority of the apicoplast proteome is encoded in the nuclear genome. The products of these nuclear genes are posttranslationally targeted to the organelle via the secretory pathway courtesy of a bipartite N-terminal leader sequence. Apicoplasts are nonphotosynthetic but retain other typical plastid functions such as fatty acid, isoprenoid and heme synthesis, and products of these pathways might be exported from the apicoplast for use by the parasite. Apicoplast pathways are essentially prokaryotic and therefore excellent drug targets. Some antibiotics inhibiting these molecular processes are already in chemotherapeutic use, whereas many new drugs will hopefully spring from our growing understanding of this intriguing organelle.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexa are intracellular parasites that cause important human diseases including malaria and toxoplasmosis. During host cell infection new parasites are formed through a budding process that parcels out nuclei and organelles into multiple daughters. Budding is remarkably flexible in output and can produce two to thousands of progeny cells. How genomes and daughters are counted and coordinated is unknown. Apicomplexa evolved from single celled flagellated algae, but with the exception of the gametes, lack flagella. Here we demonstrate that a structure that in the algal ancestor served as the rootlet of the flagellar basal bodies is required for parasite cell division. Parasite striated fiber assemblins (SFA) polymerize into a dynamic fiber that emerges from the centrosomes immediately after their duplication. The fiber grows in a polarized fashion and daughter cells form at its distal tip. As the daughter cell is further elaborated it remains physically tethered at its apical end, the conoid and polar ring. Genetic experiments in Toxoplasma gondii demonstrate two essential components of the fiber, TgSFA2 and 3. In the absence of either of these proteins cytokinesis is blocked at its earliest point, the initiation of the daughter microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Mitosis remains unimpeded and mutant cells accumulate numerous nuclei but fail to form daughter cells. The SFA fiber provides a robust spatial and temporal organizer of parasite cell division, a process that appears hard-wired to the centrosome by multiple tethers. Our findings have broader evolutionary implications. We propose that Apicomplexa abandoned flagella for most stages yet retained the organizing principle of the flagellar MTOC. Instead of ensuring appropriate numbers of flagella, the system now positions the apical invasion complexes. This suggests that elements of the invasion apparatus may be derived from flagella or flagellum associated structures.},

Global regulation is carried out throughout the cytoplasm by diffusible factors that include cell cycle-specific kinases, cyclins and transcription factors. Local regulation acts on individual nuclei and daughter cells that are developing inside the mother cell.

Alignment-based techniques provide additional benefits. In spite of high success rates signal peptide predictors yield false predictions. Simple sequences like polyvaline, for example, are predicted as signal peptides. The general architecture of learning systems makes it difficult to trace the cause of such problems. This kind of false predictions can be recognized or avoided altogether by using sequence comparison techniques. Based on these results we have implemented a public web service, called Signal-BLAST. Predictions returned by Signal-BLAST are transparent and easy to analyze. AVAILABILITY: Signal-BLAST is available online at http://sigpep.services.came.sbg.ac.at/signalblast.html.},

Likewise, several import and export receptor molecules that are crucial for nuclear transport are either not present or have experienced genetic drift such that they are no longer recognizable by bioinformatics tools.

Enzyme binding resulted in a change of the lambda max of pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside from 303 nm for the free species to 239 nm for the bound species. The value for the bound species was identical with that of an oxygen adduct formed by combination of hydroxide ion with 1,3-dimethyl-2-oxopyrimidinium (239 nm), but lower than that of a sulfur adduct formed by combination of the thiolate anion of N-acetylcysteamine with 1,3-dimethyl-2-oxopyrimidinium (259 nm). The results suggest that pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside is bound by cytidine deaminase as an oxygen adduct, probably the covalent hydrate 3,4-dihydrouridine, rather than intact or as an adduct involving a thiol group of the enzyme. In dilute solution at 25 degrees C, the equilibrium constant for formation of a single diastereomer of 3,4-dihydrouridine from pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside was estimated as approximately 4.7 x 10(-6), from equilibria of dissociation of water, protonation of 1-methylpyrimidin-2-one, and combination of the 1,3-dimethylpyrimidinium cation with the hydroxide ion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Numerous intracellular pathogens exploit cell surface glycoconjugates for host cell recognition and entry. Unlike bacteria and viruses, Toxoplasma gondii and other parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa actively invade host cells, and this process critically depends on adhesins (microneme proteins) released onto the parasite surface from intracellular organelles called micronemes (MIC). The microneme adhesive repeat (MAR) domain of T. gondii MIC1 (TgMIC1) recognizes sialic acid (Sia), a key determinant on the host cell surface for invasion by this pathogen. By complementation and invasion assays, we demonstrate that TgMIC1 is one important player in Sia-dependent invasion and that another novel Sia-binding lectin, designated TgMIC13, is also involved. Using BLAST searches, we identify a family of MAR-containing proteins in enteroparasitic coccidians, a subclass of apicomplexans, including T. gondii, suggesting that all these parasites exploit sialylated glycoconjugates on host cells as determinants for enteric invasion. Furthermore, this protein family might provide a basis for the broad host cell range observed for coccidians that form tissue cysts during chronic infection. Carbohydrate microarray analyses, corroborated by structural considerations, show that TgMIC13, TgMIC1, and its homologue Neospora caninum MIC1 (NcMIC1) share a preference for alpha2-3- over alpha2-6-linked sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine sequences. However, the three lectins also display differences in binding preferences. Intense binding of TgMIC13 to alpha2-9-linked disialyl sequence reported on embryonal cells and relatively strong binding to 4-O-acetylated-Sia found on gut epithelium and binding of NcMIC1 to 6'sulfo-sialyl Lewis(x) might have implications for tissue tropism.},

   abstract = {Members of the phylum Apicomplexa, which includes the species Plasmodium, Eimeria, Toxoplasma, and Babesia amongst others, are the most successful intracellular pathogens known to humankind. The widespread acquisition of antimicrobial resistance to most drugs used to date has sparked a great deal of research and commercial interest in the development of vaccines as alternative control strategies. A few antigens from the asexual and sexual stages of apicomplexan development have been identified and their genes characterised; however, the fine cellular and molecular details of the effector mechanisms crucial for parasite inhibition and stimulation of protective immunity are still not entirely understood. This paper provides an overview of what is currently known about the protective immune response against the various types of apicomplexan parasites and focuses mainly on the similarities of these pathogens and their host interaction. Finally, the evolutionary relationships of these parasites and their hosts, as well as the modulation of immune functions that are critical in determining the outcome of the infection by these pathogenic organisms, are discussed.},

In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to approximately 24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to approximately 8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions. AVAILABILITY: http://cd-hit.org.

   abstract = {Almost all secretory proteins have a sequence consisting of 15-30 amino acids at the N-terminus (the so-called N-terminal signal peptide). Signal peptides direct the propeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum and through the secretory pathway. Although the sequences of signal peptides vary greatly, all contain a basic amino acid in the N-terminal region, followed by a hydrophobic core region. With the aim of improving the level of secretion of recombinant proteins in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), we designed several signal peptides based on the signal peptide of silkworm SP1 by introducing the basic amino acid arginine into the N-terminal region and/or the polar amino acid asparagine into the C-terminal region of the silkworm SP1 signal peptide. Human interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and the extracellular domain of human IL-11 receptor alpha1 (IL-11Ralpha1) were fused to wild-type and modified SP1 signal peptides, and the effects that each signal peptide had on secretion were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Introduction of the basic amino acid arginine into the N-terminal region did not result in an increase in secretion of the recombinant proteins. On the other hand, introduction of the polar amino acid asparagine into the C-terminal region enhanced secretion of the recombinant proteins. Therefore, it is suggested that polar amino acids in the C-terminal region of signal peptides are important in the secretion of recombinant proteins in BEVS.},

In the present study, we investigated the occurrence of this phenomenon in two distantly related apicomplexan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of toxoplasmosis, and the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. A low-scale molecular characterization of the small RNA fraction of T. gondii revealed the endonucleolytic processing of 10 distinct tRNA species, with cleavage in the anticodon loop and upstream of the 3'-terminal CCA sequence yielding 5'- or 3'-end half-tRNAs. T. gondii and P. berghei exhibited variable rates of tRNA cleavage upon egress from host cells and in response to stage differentiation, amino acid starvation and heat-shock. Moreover, avirulent isolates of T. gondii and attenuated P. berghei parasites showed a higher rate of tRNA cleavage than virulent strains. Interestingly, half-tRNA production was significantly higher in the metabolically quiescent bradyzoite and sporozoite stages of T. gondii, compared to the fast-growing tachyzoite. Collectively, our findings shed light for the first time on the occurrence of tRNA cleavage in apicomplexan parasites and suggest a relationship between half-tRNA production and growth rate in this important group of organisms.},

The goals of the present work are as follows: increase PSORTb's coverage while maintaining the existing precision level, expand it to include Gram-positive bacteria and then carry out a comparative analysis of localization. RESULTS: An expanded database of proteins of known localization and new modules using frequent subsequence-based support vector machines was introduced into PSORTb v.2.0. The program attains a precision of 96% for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and predictive coverage comparable to other tools for whole proteome analysis. We show that the proportion of proteins at each localization is remarkably consistent across species, even in species with varying proteome size.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyloids are proteins capable of forming fibrils whose intramolecular contact sites assume densely packed zipper pattern. Their oligomers can underlie serious diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Recent studies show that short segments of aminoacids can be responsible for amyloidogenic properties of a protein. A few hundreds of such peptides have been experimentally found but experimental testing of all candidates is currently not feasible. Here we propose an original machine learning method for classification of aminoacid sequences, based on discovering a segment with a discriminative pattern of site-specific co-occurrences between sequence elements. The pattern is based on the positions of residues with correlated occurrence over a sliding window of a specified length. The algorithm first recognizes the most relevant training segment in each positive training instance. Then the classification is based on maximal distances between co-occurrence matrix of the relevant segments in positive training sequences and the matrix from negative training segments. The method was applied for studying sequences of aminoacids with regard to their amyloidogenic properties. RESULTS: Our method was first trained on available datasets of hexapeptides with the amyloidogenic classification, using 5 or 6-residue sliding windows. Depending on the choice of training and testing datasets, the area under ROC curve obtained the value up to 0.80 for experimental, and 0.95 for computationally generated (with 3D profile method) datasets. Importantly, the results on 5-residue segments were not significantly worse, although the classification required that algorithm first recognized the most relevant training segments. The dataset of long sequences, such as sup35 prion and a few other amyloid proteins, were applied to test the method and gave encouraging results. Our web tool FISH Amyloid was trained on all available experimental data 4-10 residues long, offers prediction of amyloidogenic segments in protein sequences. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a new original classification method which recognizes co-occurrence patterns in sequences. The method reveals characteristic classification pattern of the data and finds the segments where its scoring is the strongest, also in long training sequences. Applied to the problem of amyloidogenic segments recognition, it showed a good potential for classification problems in bioinformatics.},

   abstract = {There are several clinically useful endoperoxides, mainly artemisinin derivatives available in market for the treatment of malaria. These are highly potent drugs, with fastest parasite reduction ratio, broadest parasite stage specificity and effectiveness against all species of plasmodium in human. Endoperoxides are crystalline compounds having poor aqueous solubility. Several theories have been proposed for their mechanism of action, but the understanding is still incomplete. The major limitation of this class of compounds is the short half-life, requiring frequent administration, leading to noncompliance and recrudescence. Therefore, WHO recommends their use in combination with long acting antimalarial drugs (Artemisinin based combination therapy, ACT) to manage drug resistance, recrudescence, and non compliance. Endoperoxide compounds bind selectively to malaria-infected red blood cells and moderately to human plasma proteins. Artemisinin derivatives are converted primarily to the bioactive metabolite dihydroartemisinin after parenteral, oral or rectal administration. The rate of conversion is lowest for artelinic acid and highest for the water-soluble artesunate. Such conversion occurs largely in the liver by CYP enzymes. Oral bioavailability in animals ranges between 19 to 35%. Based on their liphophilicity, they tend to cross the blood-brain barrier, causing neurotoxicity in animal models. Efforts have been made to understand and develop pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) correlation and identify PK-PD indices of endoperoxides. In the absence of the above, the selection of doses in ACTs has been empirical. There are several reports on clinical pharmacokinetic interactions of endoperoxides and their long acting partner drugs but as on date no clinically significant interaction has been reported. This review is an update on physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the endoperoxide antimalarials.},

Here we describe the optimization of this class of hybrid drug through in-depth structure-activity relationship studies. Antiplasmodial properties and mode of action were characterized in vitro and in vivo, and interactions with the parasite's 'chloroquine resistance transporter' were investigated in a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system. These tests indicated that piperazine derivatives 4b and 4d may be suitable for coadministration with chloroquine against chloroquine-resistant parasites. The potential for metabolism of the drugs by cytochrome P450 was determined in silico, and the lead compounds were tested for toxicity and mutagenicity. A preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis undertaken in mice indicated that compound 4b has an optimal half-life.},

   abstract = {PhenCode (Phenotypes for ENCODE; http://www.bx.psu.edu/phencode) is a collaborative, exploratory project to help understand phenotypes of human mutations in the context of sequence and functional data from genome projects. Currently, it connects human phenotype and clinical data in various locus-specific databases (LSDBs) with data on genome sequences, evolutionary history, and function from the ENCODE project and other resources in the UCSC Genome Browser. Initially, we focused on a few selected LSDBs covering genes encoding alpha- and beta-globins (HBA, HBB), phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), blood group antigens (various genes), androgen receptor (AR), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), but we plan to include additional loci of clinical importance, ultimately genomewide. We have also imported variant data and associated OMIM links from Swiss-Prot. Users can find interesting mutations in the UCSC Genome Browser (in a new Locus Variants track) and follow links back to the LSDBs for more detailed information. Alternatively, they can start with queries on mutations or phenotypes at an LSDB and then display the results at the Genome Browser to view complementary information such as functional data (e.g., chromatin modifications and protein binding from the ENCODE consortium), evolutionary constraint, regulatory potential, and/or any other tracks they choose. We present several examples illustrating the power of these connections for exploring phenotypes associated with functional elements, and for identifying genomic data that could help to explain clinical phenotypes.},

   abstract = {Colpodellids are free-living, predatory flagellates, but their close relationship to photosynthetic chromerids and plastid-bearing apicomplexan parasites suggests they were ancestrally photosynthetic. Colpodellids may therefore retain a cryptic plastid, or they may have lost their plastids entirely, like the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium. To find out, we generated transcriptomic data from Voromonas pontica ATCC 50640 and searched for homologs of genes encoding proteins known to function in the apicoplast, the non-photosynthetic plastid of apicomplexans. We found candidate genes from multiple plastid-associated pathways including iron-sulfur cluster assembly, isoprenoid biosynthesis, and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, along with a plastid-type phosphate transporter gene. Four of these sequences include the 5' end of the coding region and are predicted to encode a signal peptide and a transit peptide-like region. This is highly suggestive of targeting to a cryptic plastid. We also performed a taxon-rich phylogenetic analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences from colpodellids and their relatives, which suggests that photosynthesis was lost more than once in colpodellids, and independently in V. pontica and apicomplexans. Colpodellids therefore represent a valuable source of comparative data for understanding the process of plastid reduction in humanity's most deadly parasite.},

   abstract = {Grouping of genes into clusters according to their expression levels is important for deriving biological information, e.g., on gene functions based on microarray and other related analyses. The paper introduces the selection of the number of clusters based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle for the selection of the number of clusters in gene expression data. The main feature of the new method is the ability to evaluate in a fast way the number of clusters according to the sound MDL principle, without exhaustive evaluations over all possible partitions of the gene set. The estimation method can be used in conjunction with various clustering algorithms. A recent clustering algorithm using principal component analysis, the "gene shaving" (GS) procedure, can be modified to make use of the new MDL estimation method, replacing the Gap statistics originally used in GS algorithm. The resulting clustering algorithm is shown to perform better than GS-Gap and CEM (classification expectation maximization), in the simulations using artificial data. The proposed method is applied to B-cell differentiation data, and the resulting clusters are compared with those found by self-organizing maps (SOM).},

Thus, a series of N-acylated analogues were synthesized, and their activities against blood- and liver-stage Plasmodium spp. were assessed along with their in vitro cytotoxicities. Although the new N-acylated analogues were found to be somewhat less active and more cytotoxic than their N-cinnamoylated counterparts, they equally displayed nanomolar activities in vitro against blood-stage drug-sensitive and drug-resistant P. falciparum, and significant in vitro liver-stage activity against P. berghei. Therefore, it is demonstrated that simple N-acylated surrogates of classical antimalarial drugs are promising dual-stage antimalarial leads.},

Both strains of mice responded to LPS with a 20- to 30-fold increase in plasma amyloid P component (AP) levels. There were no differences in the response between males and females or between FO and CO treatment groups. The data demonstrated that cultured peritoneal macrophages (M phi) respond to LPS stimulation with increased secretion of AP. In contrast to plasma AP levels, the MO response to LPS stimulation, as measured by production of AP, was influenced by both gender and diet. Although M phi from both male and female mice on the CO diet and male mice on the FO diet responded similarly, those from female mice on the FO diet secreted only 25 to 35% as much AP as did the other three groups. There were no dietary effects on the LPS-induced serum amyloid A protein response nor was there detectable serum amyloid A protein produced by the M phi. These results demonstrate that unstimulated, resident peritoneal M phi secrete AP as a normal constituent and in increasing amounts in response to LPS stimulation.},

Thus, the search for new molecular targets is a major goal. PfAM1 is an aminopeptidase from Plasmodium falciparum, William H. Welch 1897, belonging to the M1 family of metalloproteases, which is a promising target of inhibitors to block the intra-erythrocytic stages of the parasite. Since its identification in 1998, many efforts have been done to validate PfAM1 as an appropriate target of antimalarials. The present work is a critical review of the main structural, functional and kinetic characteristics of PfAM1, as well as a summary of the effects of key inhibitors at molecular and cellular levels. The systematization of experimental results should contribute to a better understanding of the properties of PfAM1 as a target of antimalarials and promote research projects focused on the development of PfAM1 inhibitors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There were 1,370 cases of imported malaria and six fatalities in the UK in 2008, the majority of which were due to chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Poor adherence to prescribed regimens is known to be an important factor in these cases. METHOD: An observational study utilizing questionnaires both pre- and post-travel was conducted to assess the adherence behavior of UK travelers undertaking trips of less than 28 days duration, who were prescribed one of three antimalarials recommended to prevent P falciparum malaria (atovaquone plus proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine) in travel clinics in England and Scotland. The primary objectives of the study were to assess travelers' perceptions of, and self-reported adherence to antimalarial medication. A secondary objective was to examine the reasons for the choice of antimalarial therapy from the perspective of prescriber and traveler. RESULTS: For the primary end point of self-reported adherence specified as the proportion of antimalarial tablets prescribed that were actually taken, statistically significantly higher adherence overall and post-travel was seen with atovaquone plus proguanil compared with doxycycline. It was not possible to calculate the statistical significance of comparisons with mefloquine, but adherence to mefloquine appeared similar to or better than doxycycline and similar to atovaquone plus proguanil for categorical adherence. Effectiveness, side effects, previous experience of antimalarials, and dosing convenience were the main determinants of both travelers and practitioner's choice of antimalarial. The practitioner's recommendation was highly important for 63% of travelers. CONCLUSION: A shorter post-travel regimen has a significant impact on adherence to antimalarial prophylaxis. A reassessment of the risk by travelers on returning home may be a major contributor to this poor adherence.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexans comprise some of the most life threatening parasites infecting human and livestock and includes Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, the causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis respectively, in humans as well as Neospora caninum (abortion in livestock, neosporosis in dogs), Cryptosporidium (Diarrheal cryptosporidiosis and opportunistic infections in AIDS patients) and Eimeria (poultry coccidiosis). These parasites are characterized by a complex life cycle usually alternating between sexual and asexual cycles in different hosts. The need to adapt to different host environments demands a tight regulation of gene expression during parasite development. Therefore, the understanding of parasite biology will facilitate the control of the infection and the disease. In this review we emphasize the progress made so far in gene regulation in two medically important parasites, namely Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, as well as other less known apicomplexan. The genome of both Plasmodium and Toxoplasma has been sequenced and since then there has been a significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms that control stage specific gene expression in the two parasites. In addition, the information gained in each of the parasite can be used in studying mechanisms that are still elusive in the other apicomplexans that are not readily available. Additionally, they can serve as model system for other disease causing Apicomplexan parasites.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phylum Apicomplexa is an early-branching eukaryotic lineage that contains a number of important human and animal pathogens. Their complex life cycles and unique cytoskeletal features distinguish them from other model eukaryotes. Apicomplexans rely on actin-based motility for cell invasion, yet the regulation of this system remains largely unknown. Consequently, we focused our efforts on identifying actin-related proteins in the recently completed genomes of Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Theileria spp. RESULTS: Comparative genomic and phylogenetic studies of apicomplexan genomes reveals that most contain only a single conventional actin and yet they each have 8-10 additional actin-related proteins. Among these are a highly conserved Arp1 protein (likely part of a conserved dynactin complex), and Arp4 and Arp6 homologues (subunits of the chromatin-remodeling machinery). In contrast, apicomplexans lack canonical Arp2 or Arp3 proteins, suggesting they lost the Arp2/3 actin polymerization complex on their evolutionary path towards intracellular parasitism. Seven of these actin-like proteins (ALPs) are novel to apicomplexans. They show no phylogenetic associations to the known Arp groups and likely serve functions specific to this important group of intracellular parasites. CONCLUSION: The large diversity of actin-like proteins in apicomplexans suggests that the actin protein family has diverged to fulfill various roles in the unique biology of intracellular parasites. Conserved Arps likely participate in vesicular transport and gene expression, while apicomplexan-specific ALPs may control unique biological traits such as actin-based gliding motility.},

An extensive search for new treatments exploring the unique developmental physiology, metabolism and molecular structures of Apicomplexa is under way. The description of the full complement of about 5,300 Plasmodium falciparum genes and fast growing sequence databases for other Apicomplexa allow reconstruction of metabolic pathways of these parasites and thus accelerate identification and biochemical analysis of potential targets. The apicoplast de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway shows great potential as a target for small-molecule inhibitors in a stand-alone or combination chemotherapy. Three enzymatic activities, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase and enoyl-ACP reductase, respond to inhibitors previously identified for bacteria and plants, and deserve to be explored in depth. In this connection, screening systems have been established to seek more potent and specific antiparasitic compounds that are harmless to the host. To this end the interconnections of fatty acid biosynthesis in Apicomplexa with other metabolic and cellular processes must be investigated.},

Matrix effect heavily influences both qualitative and quantitative analyses, giving rise to suppression or enhancement of the signal. As generally recognised, the predominant cause is the presence of undesired components that co-elute in the chromatographic separation and alter the ionisation process. The interfering species can be components of the sample, compounds released during the pre-treatment/extraction process or reagents added to the mobile phase to improve chromatographic resolution. The different mechanisms proposed in literature to explain the suppression or the enhancement of the signal both in electrospray and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisations are presented and the results observed in the different experimental conditions are compared and discussed. All data together lead to conclude that the chemical properties of the target analyte, the kind of matrix, the matrix to analyte concentration ratio, the extraction process, the chromatographic conditions as well as the kind of the mass spectrometry instrumentation and the ionisation conditions can play a role. Likely all these potential causes act in a synergic way and the final effect observed is hardly due to only one of them. Depending on an unpredictable combination of conditions, signal suppression or enhancement can be observed. The review discusses the matrix effects observed in HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS analysis proposes hypotheses to explain the observed behaviours and proposes methods and strategies to overcome the matrix effects.},

   abstract = {Adenosine deaminase from Aspergillus oryzae resembles mammalian adenosine deaminases in its ability to catalyze the hydrolytic removal of many substituents from C-6, and in the chirality at C-6 of the active isomer of the transition-state-analogue inhibitor 6-hydroxymethyl-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside. The 5'-OH group of adenosine has been found to contribute a factor of 5.10(4) to transition-state stabilization by calf intestinal adenosine deaminase, and crystallographic observations suggest that a zinc-histidine 'bridge' is formed between the 6-OH and the 5'-OH groups of the substrate in the transition state for its deamination. The present paper describes experiments indicating that this bridge is not present during the action of adenosine deaminase from Aspergillus oryzae. We find (1), that the fungal enzyme catalyzes deamination of adenosine and 5'-deoxyadenosine with kcat/Km values that are almost identical; (2), that the Ki value of the transition-state-analogue inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin is much higher for the fungal enzyme (2.7.10(-9) M) than for the mammalian enzyme (2.10(-12) M) and (3), that this difference in binding affinities arises mainly from a difference in rates of enzyme-inhibitor association. Thus, the onset of inhibition was markedly slower for the fungal enzyme (kon = 1.3.10(4) M-1 s-1) than for the calf intestinal enzyme (kon = 2.6.10(6) M-1 s-1). Effects of chelating agents and divalent cations suggest that the fungal enzyme, like other deaminases for adenosine and cytidine, contains essential zinc.},

Currently available methods are inadequate for genome-scale predictions with several limitations. Here, we present a new prediction method, pTARGET that can predict proteins targeted to nine different subcellular locations in the eukaryotic animal species. RESULTS: The nine subcellular locations predicted by pTARGET include cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular/secretory, golgi, lysosomes, mitochondria, nucleus, plasma membrane and peroxisomes. Predictions are based on the location-specific protein functional domains and the amino acid compositional differences across different subcellular locations. Overall, this method can predict 68-87% of the true positives at accuracy rates of 96-99%. Comparison of the prediction performance against PSORT showed that pTARGET prediction rates are higher by 11-60% in 6 of the 8 locations tested. Besides, the pTARGET method is robust enough for genome-scale prediction of protein subcellular localizations since, it does not rely on the presence of signal or target peptides. AVAILABILITY: A public web server based on the pTARGET method is accessible at the URL http://bioinformatics.albany.edu/~ptarget. Datasets used for developing pTARGET can be downloaded from this web server. Source code will be available on request from the corresponding author.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Nucleosome positioning participates in many cellular activities and plays significant roles in regulating cellular processes. With the avalanche of genome sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is highly desired to develop automated methods for rapidly and effectively identifying nucleosome positioning. Although some computational methods were proposed, most of them were species specific and neglected the intrinsic local structural properties that might play important roles in determining the nucleosome positioning on a DNA sequence. RESULTS: Here a predictor called 'iNuc-PseKNC' was developed for predicting nucleosome positioning in Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster genomes, respectively. In the new predictor, the samples of DNA sequences were formulated by a novel feature-vector called 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition', into which six DNA local structural properties were incorporated. It was observed by the rigorous cross-validation tests on the three stringent benchmark datasets that the overall success rates achieved by iNuc-PseKNC in predicting the nucleosome positioning of the aforementioned three genomes were 86.27%, 86.90% and 79.97%, respectively. Meanwhile, the results obtained by iNuc-PseKNC on various benchmark datasets used by the previous investigators for different genomes also indicated that the current predictor remarkably outperformed its counterparts.

Most often, a sizeable tumor cell subpopulation survives and remains quiescent for years, eventually resulting in acquired resistance and treatment failure. Here, we report that imatinib induces autophagy as a survival pathway in quiescent GIST cells. Inhibiting autophagy, using RNAi-mediated silencing of autophagy regulators (ATGs) or antimalarial lysosomotrophic agents, promotes the death of GIST cells both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, combining imatinib with autophagy inhibition represents a potentially valuable strategy to promote GIST cytotoxicity and to diminish both cellular quiescence and acquired resistance in GIST patients.},

   abstract = {The emerging cases of artemisinin and endoperoxide drug resistance are becoming a challenge to antimalarial drug discovery and therapy. The exact mode of action of this class of antimalarials is still unknown which presents a bottleneck for the understanding of drug resistance as well as designing new lead molecules of this class. To address this issue, the molecular docking and scoring studies of a homogeneous and structurally diverse dataset of artemisinin derived trioxanes have been performed on each of the two plausible targets of this class viz. heme and PfATP6. Since the crystal structure of PfATP6 is unknown, its homology model was built utilizing the human SERCA1 protein crystallized structure as a template. The binding energies of the heme binding site of the docked artemisinin derivatives showed very good correlation with the antimalarial activity (r(2) = 0.69), whereas the same study with the binding site of pfATP6 showed a very poor correlation (r(2) = 0.12), suggesting heme to be the possible target of artemisinin derived endoperoxides.},

The molecular target of Compound 1 was identified as cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) using a tritiated analogue to purify a approximately 120-kDa protein from lysates of Eimeria tenella. This represents the first example of a protozoal PKG. Cloning of PKG from several Apicomplexan parasites has identified a parasite signature sequence of nearly 300 amino acids that is not found in mammalian or Drosophila PKG and which contains an additional, third cGMP-binding site. Nucleotide cofactor regulation of parasite PKG is remarkably different from mammalian enzymes. The activity of both native and recombinant E. tenella PKG is stimulated 1000-fold by cGMP, with significant cooperativity. Two isoforms of the parasite enzyme are expressed from a single copy gene. NH(2)-terminal sequence of the soluble isoform of PKG is consistent with alternative translation initiation within the open reading frame of the enzyme. A larger, membrane-associated isoform corresponds to the deduced full-length protein sequence. Compound 1 is a potent inhibitor of both soluble and membrane-associated isoforms of native PKG, as well as recombinant enzyme, with an IC(50) of <1 nm.},

   abstract = {Proteins of the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family have been shown to be crucial for the motility and survival of apicomplexan parasites. However, the mechanisms by which ADF proteins fulfill their function remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the comparative activities of ADF proteins from Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, the human malaria parasite, using a conditional T. gondii ADF-knockout line complemented with ADF variants from either species. We show that P. falciparum ADF1 can fully restore native TgADF activity, demonstrating functional conservation between parasites. Strikingly, mutation of a key basic residue (Lys-72), previously implicated in disassembly in PfADF1, had no detectable phenotypic effect on parasite growth, motility, or development. In contrast, organelle segregation was severely impaired when complementing with a TgADF mutant lacking the corresponding residue (Lys-68). Biochemical analyses of each ADF protein confirmed the reduced ability of lysine mutants to mediate actin depolymerization via filament disassembly although not severing, in contrast to previous reports. These data suggest that actin filament disassembly is essential for apicomplexan parasite development but not for motility, as well as pointing to genus-specific coevolution between ADF proteins and their native actin.},

These effects make it an interesting lead for drug discovery. We have combined current structural and biological information to model the structure of hCGRP-beta to be used as a basis for the rational design of novel analogues. Distinct regions of CGRP have been shown to be responsible for the activity of the whole molecule. Thus, the structure of the peptide was modelled in four parts which were finally combined. A random search of conformational space was performed for the fragments CGRP1-8 and CGRP30-37 which have been shown to be central for receptor activation and binding, respectively. Five low-energy hCGRP-beta structures were obtained from modelled fragments by molecular dynamics. The relevance of the approach was verified by comparing the models with NMR structures of CGRP and calcitonin. The models obtained for the N- and C-terminal fragments should enable the design of novel agonists and antagonists of the CGRP receptor, respectively. Models of the whole molecule may be used in the design of peptides with shortened spacers between the receptor-bound regions. The approach described is applicable to several related peptide hormones, like growth hormone-releasing hormone and secretin.},

   abstract = {A defective form of the AIRE protein causes autoimmune destruction of target organs by disturbing the immunological tolerance of patients with a rare monogenic disease, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (APE)-candidiasis (C)-ectodermal dystrophy (ED), APECED. Recently, experiments on knockout mice revealed that AIRE controls autoimmunity by regulating the transcription of peripheral tissue-restricted antigens in thymic medullary epithelial cells. Thus, AIRE provides a unique model for molecular studies of organ-specific autoimmunity. In order to analyze the molecular and cellular consequences of 16 disease-causing mutations in vitro, we studied the subcellular localization, transactivation capacity, homomultimerization, and complex formation of several mutant AIRE polypeptides. Most of the mutations altered the nucleus-cytoplasm distribution of AIRE and disturbed its association with nuclear dots and cytoplasmic filaments. While the PHD zinc fingers were necessary for the transactivation capacity of AIRE, other regions of AIRE also modulated this function. Consequently, most of the mutations decreased transactivation. The HSR domain was responsible for the homomultimerization activity of AIRE; all the missense mutations of the HSR and the SAND domains decreased this activity, but those in other domains did not. The AIRE protein was present in soluble high-molecular-weight complexes. Mutations in the HSR domain and deletion of PHD zinc fingers disturbed the formation of these complexes. In conclusion, we propose an in vitro model in which AIRE transactivates transcription through heteromeric molecular interactions that are regulated by homomultimerization and conditional localization of AIRE in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm.},

The parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) is the critical interface between Plasmodium parasites and their possibly hostile, yet ultimately sustaining, host cell environment. We show that torins, developed as ATP-competitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitors, are fast-acting antiplasmodial compounds that unexpectedly target the parasite directly, blocking the dynamic trafficking of the Plasmodium proteins exported protein 1 (EXP1) and upregulated in sporozoites 4 (UIS4) to the liver stage PVM and leading to efficient parasite elimination by the hepatocyte. Torin2 has single-digit, or lower, nanomolar potency in both liver and blood stages of infection in vitro and is likewise effective against both stages in vivo, with a single oral dose sufficient to clear liver stage infection. Parasite elimination and perturbed trafficking of liver stage PVM-resident proteins are both specific aspects of torin-mediated Plasmodium liver stage inhibition, indicating that torins have a distinct mode of action compared with currently used antimalarials.},

Btk belongs to the Tec family of tyrosine kinases. Each member of the family contains five regions and mutations causing XLA have been isolated in all five regions. We have determined the solution structure of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Btk using two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on natural abundance and 15N-labeled protein material. The structure determination is complemented by investigation of backbone dynamics based on 15N NMR relaxation. The Btk SH3 forms a well-defined structure and shows the typical SH3 topology of two short antiparallel beta-sheets packed almost perpendicular to each other in a sandwich-like fold. The N- and C-termini are more flexible as are peptide fragments in the RT and n-Src loops. The studied Btk SH3 fragment adopts two slowly interconverting conformations with a relative concentration ratio of 7:1. The overall fold of the minor form is similar to that of the major form, as judged on the basis of observed NOE connectivities and small chemical shift differences. A tryptophan (W251) ring flip is the favored mechanism for interconversion, although other possibilities cannot be excluded. The side chain of Y223, which becomes autophosphorylated upon activation of Btk, is exposed within the potential SH3 ligand binding site. Finally, we compare the present Btk SH3 structure with other SH3 structures.},

The binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing pH in the neutral range. 3-Chloroacetol sulfate, synthesized as an active-site-specific reagent for triosephosphate isomerase, is used to provide an indication of the pKa of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme. Previously described active-site-specific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters, and their changing state of ionization (accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site) may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pKa of the essential carboxyl group from the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation. Being a strong monoprotic acid, chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pKa of the carboxyl group. Chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier. From the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase, the apparent pKa of the active-site carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.1.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To derive regional weight-for-age growth references to help optimize age-based dosing of antimalarials in Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. METHODS: A weight-for-age database was constructed from pre-existing population-based anthropometric data obtained from household surveys and research groups. It contained data collected between 1995 and 2012 on 1,263,119 individuals (909,368 female, 353,751 male) older than 14 days and younger than 50 years in 64 malaria-endemic countries. Regional growth references were generated using a generalized additive model for location, scale and shape by combining data with varying distributions from a range of sources. Countries were weighted by their population at risk of malaria to enable references to be used in optimizing the dosing of antimalarials. FINDINGS: Large differences in weight-for-age distributions existed between the regions and between the regions and global growth standards. For example, the average adult male from the Americas weighed 68.1 kg - 6.0 kg more than males in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific (average: 62.1 kg). For adult women, the difference was over 10.4 kg: the average was 60.4 kg in the Americas and 50.0 kg in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. CONCLUSION: There were substantial variations in weight-for-age growth curves between malaria-endemic areas. The growth reference charts derived here can be used to guide the evidence-based optimization of aged-based dosing regimens for antimalarials and other drugs often prescribed by age.},

   abstract = {The isolation of artemisinin from the traditional medicinal herb qing hao (Artemisia annua), its characterization as a peroxide and preparation of the derivatives dihydroartemisinin, artemether and artesunate in the 1970s and 1980s by Chinese scientists under the umbrella of Project 523 collectively represents one of the great events in medicine in the latter third of the 20(th) Century. Artemisinins have become the most important component of chemotherapy of malaria: although used initially in monotherapy, they are now used in combination therapies or ACTs with longer half-life quinolines or arylmethanols. Nevertheless, the recent emergence of artemisinin-tolerant strains of the malaria parasite as reflected in increased clearance times of parasitaemia in patients treated with ACTs represents the greatest threat to control of malaria since resistance to chloroquine was first reported over 55 years ago. Importantly, the event brings into sharp focus the realization that relatively little is precisely understood, as opposed to widely assumed, for the mechanism of drug action of artemisinins and their synthetic peroxide analogues. Thus, we review here their antimalarial activities, the use of artemisinins in combination therapies, drug-drug interactions with the quinolines and arylmethanols, and metabolism of the artemisinins and synthetic peroxides. The mechanism of action of quinolines and arylmethanols, in particular their ability to induce redistribution of heme into the parasite cytosol, is also highlighted. This collective information is then used as a counterpoint to screen the validity of two of the prevailing hypotheses of drug action of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides, namely i. 'the C-radical hypothesis' wherein the peroxide undergoes 'bioactivation' by ferrous iron to generate C-radicals that are held to be the cytotoxic agents and ii. the 'heme hypothesis' wherein ferrous heme may generate either the same type of 'cytotoxic' C-radical, or the peroxide forms heme adducts that apparently inherit the exquisite cytotoxicities of the parent peroxide in one way or another. In a subsequent review, we screen the third and fourth hypotheses: the SERCA hypothesis wherein artemisinins modulate operation of the malaria parasite sarcoendo plasmic reticulum calcium pump SERCA Ca(2+)-ATPase ATP6 and the co-factor hypothesis wherein artemisinins act as oxidant drugs through rapidly oxidizing reduced conjugates of flavin cofactors, or those of flavin cofactor precursors such as riboflavin, and other susceptible endogenous substrates that play a role in maintaining intraparasitic redox homeostasis. For the C-radical hypothesis, details of in vitro chemical studies in the context of established chemistry of C-radicals and their ability to react with radical trapping agents such as nitroso compounds, cyclic nitrones, persistent nitroxyl radicals and atmospheric oxygen (dioxygen) are summarized. Overall, there is no correlation between antimalarial activities and abilities of the derived C-radicals to react with trapping agents in a chemical flask. This applies in particular to the reactions of C-radicals from artemisinins and steroidal tetraoxanes with the trapping agents vis-a-vis those from adamantyl capped systems. In an intraparasitic medium, it is not possible to intercept C-radicals either through use of a vast excess of a nitroxyl radical or dioxygen. The lack of correlation of antimalarial activities also applies to the Fe(2+)-mediated decomposition of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides, where literature data taken as indicating otherwise are critically assessed. The antagonism to antimalarial activities of artemisinins exerted by desferrioxamine (DFO) and related Fe(3+)-chelating agents is due to formation of stable chelates with bioavailable Fe(3+) that shuts down redox cycling through Fe(2+) and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the Fenton reaction. The generation of ROS by Fe(2+) complements the action of artemisinins, to be discussed in Part 2; there is no need to posit a reaction of Fe(2+) with the artemisinins to account for their antimalarial activity. The ability of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides to elicit membrane damage is examined in the light of established processes of autoxidation. The oxidant character of the intraparasitic environment is incompatible with the reducing conditions required for generation of C-radicals, and in contrast to the expectation raised by the C-radical hypothesis, and indeed by the heme hypothesis outlined below, antimalarial activities of artemisinins are enhanced under higher partial pressures of dioxygen. Structure-activity data from a wide variety of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides cannot be accommodated within the bounds of the C-radical hypothesis. Finally, the antimalarial Cradical construct sharply contrasts with that of the potently antitumour-active ene-diyne antibiotics such as neocarzinostatin. In an iron-free process, these compounds generate highly reactive aryl C-radicals that abstract H atoms from deoxyribose units in DNA to generate alkyl C-radicals. The last do react with dioxygen in a normal intracellular environment to initiate DNA strand cleavage. Overall, it must be concluded that the C-radical hypothesis as the basis for antimalarial activities of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides is untenable. Heme has been intensively studied as an 'activator' of artemisinins and other antimalarial peroxides, and indeed the hypothesis seemingly has become firmly embedded in the underlying brickwork of the scientific edifice. The locus of activity of the peroxides interacting with the heme is considered to be the parasite digestive vacuole. The basis for the nanomolar activities of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides is variously ascribed to heme-Fe(2+)-mediated generation of C-radicals from the peroxides, formation of heme-artemisinin adducts that are held either to engage in redox cycling with concomitant generation of ROS or to inhibit formation of hemozoin. In the last case, just like the aminoquinolines and arylmethanols, the peroxides are not the active agents, but exert their parasiticidal effects through allowing the build-up of free heme-Fe(3+), the ultimate cytotoxic entity. We assess the literature relating to generation of heme by hemoglobin digestion, and the stage at which this process becomes significant in the intraerythrocytic parasite. The claims of production of heme and conversion into hemozoin occurring in a lipid environment may have to be put aside based on recent literature data that indicates crystallization of hemozoin must take place an aqueous interface; association of lipids with the heme/hemozoin is likely to be a reflection of attractive van der Waals interactions involving the hydrophobic surface of the heme or hemozoin aggregates. In addition, the observation leading to the claim that hemozoin manufacture commences at the mid-ring stage cannot be independently verified. That the quinoline and arylmethanol antimalarials have essentially no activities on the ring stage parasites and exert greatest efficacy at the trophozoite stage where heme production is maximal is consistent with this. Conversely, artemisinins, and indeed redox active drugs such as methylene blue and others, are highly active against early ring stage parasites. Thus, there is a prominent disconnect between stage specificities of artemisinins vis-a-vis those of 4-aminoquinolines and arylmethanols suggesting that heme is not the target of the former class of drug. Further, the ability of the Fe(3+) chelate DFO to antagonize antimalarial activities of artemisinins, but not the activities of 4-aminoquinolines, cannot be explained by involvement of heme as a target for artemisinins. We critically examine the basis for formation of products obtained from reaction of heme with artemisinins and synthetic peroxides under conditions ranging from biomimetic - reactions employing catalytic reagents under aqueous or semi-aqueous conditions - to those conducted under highly reducing and eminently artificial conditions, usually in the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) that both forms well characterized complexes with heme-Fe(2+) and actually assists in driving single electron transfer processes. It is noted that alkylated products tend to form in high yields under the last conditions, and this aspect is readily explained. Irrespective of product yields obtained under various conditions, an overarching correlation between facility of the reaction of the peroxide with heme and their antimalarial activities does not exist. The is underscored by the reproducible outcomes of reactions conducted under biomimetic conditions indicating adducts cannot form in physiologically meaningful concentrations and that heme is a recalcitrant reaction partner to artemisinins in general. Again, as in the case of the C-radical hypothesis, structure-activity data from a wide variety of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides is difficult to reconcile with the heme hypothesis. This applies in particular to dimeric and trimeric artemisinin derivatives where the ascribing of biological activity to reactions of the derived radicals or to the vastly encumbered artemisinin-heme adducts is physically unrealistic. Finally, the facile metabolism and induction of metabolism of the current clinically used artemisinins by members of the CYP superfamily - heme proteins that require an intimate interaction of the heme with the artemisinin for metabolism to occur - is incompatible with the oft-cited proclivity of the peroxide to associate via complex formation with heme as a prelude to its 'activation' as an antimalarial agent within the malaria parasite.

Thus, methods to enhance antigen expression/presentation could augment the effect of cancer immune therapy. In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of modifying a cytokine signal peptide with a tumor antigenic epitope. We inserted the genes encoding the MHC class I-restricted antigenic epitope of chicken ovalbumin and tyrosinase-related protein 2 into the signal sequence of the interleukin-2 gene, replacing part of the signal sequence at different positions. Our results showed that these modified signal peptides still functioned, as indicated by cytokine secretion. The antigenic epitope within the modified signal peptide could be processed properly and presented on tumor cell surface. Tumor cells demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity as indicated by increased susceptibility to CTL lysis in vitro and decreased tumor grow in vivo after gene modification. These data provide potential perspectives in designing therapeutic or vaccine strategies in immuno-gene therapy of cancer.},

Recent studies have identified many exceptions to the widely held view that signal sequences are simple, degenerate and interchangeable. Growing evidence indicates that signal sequences contain information that specifies the choice of targeting pathway, the efficiency of translocation, the timing of cleavage and even postcleavage functions. As a consequence, signal sequences can have important roles in modulating protein biogenesis. Based on a synthesis of studies in numerous experimental systems, we propose that substrate-specific sequence elements embedded in a conserved domain structure impart unique and physiologically important functionality to signal sequences.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, employ a unique form of substrate-dependent locomotion known as gliding motility. In these obligate, intracellular parasites, gliding motility is used for migration through the tissues and cells of the host, for active penetration of the host cell, and, at times, for proactive egress from the host. Gliding motility is powered by an actin-myosin based motor apparatus, known as the glideosome, which is situated within the elaborate cortical domain of the parasite. In this system, myosin is anchored to an internal membrane complex and drives the rearward translocation of actin-associated cell surface adhesins, thus leading to forward movement of the parasite. This review outlines our current understanding of glideosome architecture and the molecular basis of parasite motility.},

Homologues of yeast GCN5 have been found in Tetrahymena, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and human, suggesting that this pathway of chromatin remodelling is evolutionarily conserved. Consistent with this view, we have identified the Toxoplasma gondii homologue, referred to here as TgGCN5. The gene codes for a protein of 474 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 53 kDa. The protein reveals two regions of close similarity with the GCN5 family members, the HAT domain and the bromodomain. Tg GCN5 occurs in a single copy in the T.gondii genome. The introduction of a second copy of TgGCN5 in T.gondii tachyzoites is toxic unless the HAT activity is disrupted by a single point mutation. Full TgGCN5 does not complement the growth defect in a yeast gcn5 (-)mutant strain, but a chimera comprising the T.gondii HAT domain fused to the remainder of yGCN5 does. These data show that T.gondii GNC5 is a histone acetyltransferase attesting to the significance of chromatin remodelling in gene regulation of Apicomplexa.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial (mt) genomes vary considerably in size, structure and gene content. The mt genomes of the phylum Apicomplexa, which includes important human pathogens such as the malaria parasite Plasmodium, also show marked diversity of structure. Plasmodium has a concatenated linear mt genome of the smallest size (6-kb); Babesia and Theileria have a linear monomeric mt genome (6.5-kb to 8.2-kb) with terminal inverted repeats; Eimeria, which is distantly related to Plasmodium and Babesia/Theileria, possesses a mt genome (6.2-kb) with a concatemeric form similar to that of Plasmodium; Cryptosporidium, the earliest branching lineage within the phylum Apicomplexa, has no mt genome. We are interested in the evolutionary origin of linear mt genomes of Babesia/Theileria, and have investigated mt genome structures in members of archaeopiroplasmid, a lineage branched off earlier from Babesia/Theileria. RESULTS: The complete mt genomes of archaeopiroplasmid parasites, Babesia microti and Babesia rodhaini, were sequenced. The mt genomes of B. microti (11.1-kb) and B. rodhaini (6.9-kb) possess two pairs of unique inverted repeats, IR-A and IR-B. Flip-flop inversions between two IR-As and between two IR-Bs appear to generate four distinct genome structures that are present at an equi-molar ratio. An individual parasite contained multiple mt genome structures, with 20 copies and 2 - 3 copies per haploid nuclear genome in B. microti and B. rodhaini, respectively. CONCLUSION: We found a novel linear monomeric mt genome structure of B. microti and B. rhodhaini equipped with dual flip-flop inversion system, by which four distinct genome structures are readily generated. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the presence of two pairs of distinct IR sequences within a monomeric linear mt genome. The present finding provides insight into further understanding of evolution of mt genome structure.},

   abstract = {Mitochondrial (mt) genomes from diverse phylogenetic groups vary considerably in size, structure, and organization. The genus Plasmodium, causative agent of malaria, of the phylum Apicomplexa, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a circular and/or tandemly repeated linear element of 6 kb, encoding only three protein genes (cox1, cox3, and cob). The closely related genera Babesia and Theileria also have small mt genomes (6.6 kb) that are monomeric linear with an organization distinct from Plasmodium. To elucidate the structural divergence and evolution of mt genomes between Babesia/Theileria and Plasmodium, we determined five new sequences from Babesia bigemina, B. caballi, B. gibsoni, Theileria orientalis, and T. equi. Together with previously reported sequences of B. bovis, T. annulata, and T. parva, all eight Babesia and Theileria mt genomes are linear molecules with terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) on both ends containing three protein-coding genes (cox1, cox3, and cob) and six large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene fragments. The organization and transcriptional direction of protein-coding genes and the rRNA gene fragments were completely conserved in the four Babesia species. In contrast, notable variation occurred in the four Theileria species. Although the genome structures of T. annulata and T. parva were nearly identical to those of Babesia, an inversion in the 3-kb central region was found in T. orientalis. Moreover, the T. equi mt genome is the largest (8.2 kb) and most divergent with unusually long TIR sequences, in which cox3 and two LSU rRNA gene fragments are located. The T. equi mt genome showed little synteny to the other species. These results suggest that the Theileria mt genome is highly diverse with lineage-specific evolution in two Theileria species: genome inversion in T. orientalis and gene-embedded long TIR in T. equi.},

   abstract = {When the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum infects erythrocytes, proteins associated with host-derived detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) rafts are selectively recruited into the newly formed vacuole, but parasite proteins that contribute to raft-based vacuole development are unknown. In mammalian cells, DRM-associated integral membrane proteins such as caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 that form oligomers have been linked to the formation of DRM-based invaginations called caveolae. Here we show that the P. falciparum genome does not encode caveolins or flotillins but does contain an orthologue of human band 7 stomatin, a protein known to oligomerize, associate with non-caveolar DRMs and is distantly related to flotillins. Stomatins are members of a large protein family conserved in evolution and P. falciparum (Pf) stomatin appears to be a prokaryotic-like molecule. Evidence is presented that it associates with DRMs and may oligomerize, suggesting that these features are conserved in the stomatin family. Further, Pfstomatin is an integral membrane protein concentrated at the apical end of extracellular parasites, where it co-localizes with invasion-associated rhoptry organelles. A resident rhoptry protein, RhopH2 also resides in DRMs. This provides the first evidence that rhoptries of an apicomplexan parasite contain DRM rafts. Further, when the parasite invades erythrocytes, rhoptry Pfstomatin and RhopH2 are inserted into the newly formed vacuole. Thus, like caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, a stomatin may also associate with non-clathrin coated, DRM-enriched vacuoles. We propose a new model of invasion and vacuole formation involving DRM-based interactions of both host and parasite molecules.},

   abstract = {The main function of CAs (carbonic anhydrases) is to participate in the regulation of acid-base balance. Although 12 active isoenzymes of this family had already been described, analyses of genomic databases suggested that there still exists another isoenzyme, CA XV. Sequence analyses were performed to identify those species that are likely to have an active form of this enzyme. Eight species had genomic sequences encoding CA XV, in which all the amino acid residues critical for CA activity are present. However, based on the sequence data, it was apparent that CA XV has become a non-processed pseudogene in humans and chimpanzees. RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) confirmed that humans do not express CA XV. In contrast, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization performed in mice showed positive expression in the kidney, brain and testis. A prediction of the mouse CA XV structure was performed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that mouse CA XV is related to CA IV. Therefore both of these enzymes were expressed in COS-7 cells and studied in parallel experiments. The results showed that CA XV shares several properties with CA IV, i.e. it is a glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, and it binds CA inhibitor. The catalytic activity of CA XV is low, and the correct formation of disulphide bridges is important for the activity. Both specific and non-specific chaperones increase the production of active enzyme. The results suggest that CA XV is the first member of the alpha-CA gene family that is expressed in several species, but not in humans and chimpanzees.},

N-terminal signal peptides guide proteins to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiate translocation into the ER lumen. Here, we review the status of signal peptide architecture and prediction with an emphasis on exceptionally long signal peptides, which often escape the notion of the currently available prediction methods. We benchmark publicly available prediction methods for their ability to correctly identify exceptionally long signal peptides. A set of 136 annotated eukaryotic signals served as reference data. The best prediction tool detected only 63%. A potential reason for the poor performance is the domain architecture of long signal peptides, whose structural peculiarities are insufficiently considered by current prediction algorithms. To overcome this limitation, we motivate a general domain view of long signal peptides, which becomes detectable when both the overall length and secondary structure of long signal peptides are taken into consideration. This concept provides a structural framework for identifying and understanding multiple targeting and post-targeting functions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Repeated antimalarial treatment for febrile episodes and self-treatment are common in malaria-endemic areas. The intake of antimalarials prior to participating in an in vivo study may alter treatment outcome and affect the interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes. We report the findings from baseline plasma sampling of malaria patients prior to inclusion into an in vivo study in Tanzania and discuss the implications of residual concentrations of antimalarials in this setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In an in vivo study conducted in a rural area of Tanzania in 2008, baseline plasma samples from patients reporting no antimalarial intake within the last 28 days were screened for the presence of 14 antimalarials (parent drugs or metabolites) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Among the 148 patients enrolled, 110 (74.3%) had at least one antimalarial in their plasma: 80 (54.1%) had lumefantrine above the lower limit of calibration (LLC = 4 ng/mL), 7 (4.7%) desbutyl-lumefantrine (4 ng/mL), 77 (52.0%) sulfadoxine (0.5 ng/mL), 15 (10.1%) pyrimethamine (0.5 ng/mL), 16 (10.8%) quinine (2.5 ng/mL) and none chloroquine (2.5 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients with detectable antimalarial drug levels prior to enrollment into the study is worrying. Indeed artemether-lumefantrine was supposed to be available only at government health facilities. Although sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is only recommended for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), it was still widely used in public and private health facilities and sold in drug shops. Self-reporting of previous drug intake is unreliable and thus screening for the presence of antimalarial drug levels should be considered in future in vivo studies to allow for accurate assessment of treatment outcome. Furthermore, persisting sub-therapeutic drug levels of antimalarials in a population could promote the spread of drug resistance. The knowledge on drug pressure in a given population is important to monitor standard treatment policy implementation.},

The coding sequences for echistatin (Echis) and human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) were inserted in-frame with the MELIsp. S. cerevisiae transformants containing the resulting expression vectors secreted negligible amounts of either Echis or PAI-1. Using site-directed mutagenesis, several mutations were introduced into the MEL1sp. Two mutations were identified which dramatically increased the secretion of both Echis and PAI-1 to levels similar to those achieved when using the yeast MFαl pre-pro secretory leader. In particular, increasing the hydrophobicity of the core region plus the addition of a positive charge to the N-terminal domain of the MEL1 sp resulted in the greatest increase in the secretion levels of those two proteins.},

   abstract = {Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a secreted glycoprotein found in the extracellular matrices of skeletal tissues. Mutations associated with two human skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, disturb COMP secretion leading to intracellular accumulation of mutant COMP, especially in chondrocytes. Here we show that the manifestation of this secretory defect is dramatically influenced by the signal peptide that targets COMP for secretion. The comparison of wild type and mutant COMP secretion directed by the COMP or BM40 signal peptide in HEK-293 cells and rat chondrosarcoma cells revealed that the BM40 signal peptide substantially enhances secretion of mutant COMP that accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum-like structures when targeted by its own signal peptide. Additionally, we demonstrate that mutant COMP forms mixed pentamers with wild type COMP. Our findings suggest that the secretory defect in pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is not specific for chondrocytes, nor does it require interaction of mutant COMP with other matrix proteins prior to transport from the cell. They also imply a previously unappreciated role for the signal peptide in the regulation of protein secretion beyond targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the utility of single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for mutation screening in the BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene, we investigated 56 X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) families. To obtain genotype/ phenotype correlations, predicted protein aberrations were correlated with the clinical course of the disease. PATIENTS: This study included 56 patients with XLA, with or without a positive family history, who were diagnosed on the basis of their clinical features, low peripheral B-cell count, and low immunoglobulin levels. Ten patients with isolated hypogammaglobulinemia and 50 healthy males served as controls. METHODS: SSCP analysis was performed for the entire BTK gene, including the exon-intron boundaries and the promoter region. Structural implications of the missense mutations were investigated by molecular modeling, and the functional consequences of some mutations also were evaluated by in vitro kinase assays and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: We report the largest series of patients with XLA to date. All but 5 of the 56 index patients with XLA screened with SSCP analysis showed BTK gene abnormalities, and in 2 of the 5 SSCP-negative patients, no BTK protein was found by Western blot analysis. There were 51 mutations, including 37 novel ones, distributed across the entire gene. This report contains the first promoter mutation as well as 14 novel missense mutations with the first ones described for the Tec homology domain and the glycine-rich motif in the SH1 domain. Each index patient had a different mutation, except for four mutations, each in two unrelated individuals. This result supports the strong tendency for private mutations in this disease. No mutations were found in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that molecular genetic testing by SSCP analysis provides an accurate tool for the definitive diagnosis of XLA and the discrimination of borderline cases, such as certain hypogammaglobulinemia or common variable immunodeficiency patients with overlapping clinical features. Genotype/ phenotype correlations are not currently possible, making prediction of the clinical course based on molecular genetic data infeasible.},

The method is based on the identification of a list of distinguishing features between proteins found in the urine of healthy people and proteins deemed not to be urine excretory. These features are used to train a classifier to distinguish the two classes of proteins. When used in conjunction with information of which proteins are differentially expressed in diseased tissues of a specific type versus control tissues, this method can be used to predict potential urine markers for the disease. Here we report the detailed algorithm of this method and an application to identification of urine markers for gastric cancer. The performance of the trained classifier on 163 proteins was experimentally validated using antibody arrays, achieving >80% true positive rate. By applying the classifier on differentially expressed genes in gastric cancer vs normal gastric tissues, it was found that endothelial lipase (EL) was substantially suppressed in the urine samples of 21 gastric cancer patients versus 21 healthy individuals. Overall, we have demonstrated that our predictor for urine excretory proteins is highly effective and could potentially serve as a powerful tool in searches for disease biomarkers in urine in general.},

   abstract = {The soil of potato fields in The Netherlands harbors bacteria with the ability to metabolize 3-chloroacrylic acid, generated by the degradation of a pesticide (1,3-dichloropropene) that entered the environment in 1946. From examination of rate constants at elevated temperatures, we infer that the half-time at 25 degrees C for spontaneous hydrolytic dechlorination of trans-3-chloroacrylic acid is 10,000 years, several orders of magnitude longer than half-times for spontaneous decomposition of other environmental pollutants such as 1,2-dichloroethane (72 years), paraoxon (13 months), atrazine (5 months), and aziridine (52 h). With thermodynamic parameters for activation similar to those for the spontaneous hydration of fumarate at pH 6.8, this slow reaction proceeds at a constant rate through the pH range between 2 and 12. However, at the active site of the enzyme 3-chloroacrylate dehalogenase (CaaD), isolated from a pseudomonad growing in these soils, hydrolytic dechlorination proceeds with a half-time of 0.18 s. Neither k(cat) nor k(cat)/K(m) is reduced by increasing solvent viscosity with trehalose, implying that the rate of enzymatic dechlorination is controlled by chemical events in catalysis rather than by diffusion-limited substrate binding or product release. CaaD achieves an approximately 10(12)-fold rate enhancement, matching or surpassing the rate enhancements produced by many enzymes that act on more conventional biological substrates. One of those enzymes is 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, with which CaaD seems to share a common evolutionary origin.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agents of severe malaria and toxoplasmosis, respectively, undergo several critical developmental transitions during their lifecycle. Most important for human pathogenesis is the asexual cycle, in which parasites undergo rounds of host cell invasion, replication, and egress (exit), destroying host cell tissue in the process. Previous work has identified important roles for Protein Kinase G (PKG) and Protein Kinase A (PKA) in parasite egress and invasion, yet little is understood about the regulation of cyclic nucleotides, cGMP and cAMP, that activate these enzymes. To address this, we have focused upon the development of inhibitors of 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to block the breakdown of cyclic nucleotides. This was done by repurposing human PDE inhibitors noting various similarities of the human and apicomplexan PDE binding sites. The most potent inhibitors blocked the in vitro proliferation of P. falciparum and T. gondii more potently than the benchmark compound zaprinast. 5-Benzyl-3-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-one (BIPPO) was found to be a potent inhibitor of recombinant P. falciparum PfPDEalpha and activated PKG-dependent egress of T. gondii and P. falciparum, likely by promoting the exocytosis of micronemes, an activity that was reversed by a specific Protein Kinase G inhibitor. BIPPO also promotes cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of a P. falciparum ligand critical for host cell invasion, suggesting that the compound inhibits single or multiple PDE isoforms that regulate both cGMP and cAMP levels. BIPPO is therefore a useful tool for the dissection of signal transduction pathways in apicomplexan parasites.},

The thermodynamic parameters for the binding of L-dihydroorotate were determined at 25 degrees C for hamster DHOase (deltaG = -6.9 kcal/mol, deltaH = -11.5 kcal/mol, TdeltaS = -4.6 kcal/mol) and B. caldolyticus DHOase (deltaG = -5.6 kcal/mol, deltaH = -4.2 kcal/mol, TdeltaS = +1.4 kcal/mol). The smaller enthalpy release and positive entropy for thermophilic DHOase are indicative of a weakly interacting Michaelis complex. Hamster DHOase has an enthalpy of activation of 12.3 kcal/mol, similar to the release of enthalpy upon substrate binding, rendering the kcat/Ks value almost temperature independent. B. caldolyticus DHOase shows a decrease in the enthalpy of activation from 12.2 kcal/mol at temperatures from 30 to 50 degrees C to 5.3 kcal/mol for temperatures of 50-70 degrees C. Vibrational energy at higher temperatures may facilitate the transition ES --> ES(double dagger), making kcat/Ks almost temperature independent. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for water attack on L-dihydroorotate, based on experiments at elevated temperature, is 3.2 x 10(-11) s(-1) at 25 degrees C, with deltaH(double dagger) = 24.7 kcal/mol and TdeltaS(double dagger) = -6.9 kcal/mol. Thus, hamster DHOase enhances the rate of substrate hydrolysis by a factor of 1.6 x 10(14), achieving this rate enhancement almost entirely by lowering the enthalpy of activation (delta deltaH(double dagger) = -19.5 kcal/mol). Both the rate enhancement and transition state affinity of hamster DHOase increase steeply with decreasing temperature, consistent with the development of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions in the transition state that were not present in the enzyme-substrate complex in the ground state.},

Many targets not involving folate metabolism have also been explored at the experimental level. However, the unravelling of the genome sequences of these eukaryotic unicellular organisms, together with increasingly sophisticated molecular analyses, opens up possibilities of introducing new drugs that could interfere with these processes.

Nucleotide strand hybridization forms the underlying principle for these methods. For all these techniques, the probes should be unique for analyzed genes. In addition to being unique for the studied genes, the probes should fulfill a large number of criteria to be usable and valid. The criteria include for example, avoidance of self-annealing, suitable melting temperature and nucleotide composition. We developed a method for searching unique and valid oligonucleotides or probes for genes so that there is not even a similar (approximate) occurrence in any other location of the whole genome. By using probe size 25, we analyzed 17 complete genomes representing a wide range of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. More than 92% of all the genes in the investigated genomes contained valid oligonucleotides. Extensive statistical tests were performed to characterize the properties of unique and valid oligonucleotides. Unique and valid oligonucleotides were relatively evenly distributed in genes except for the beginning and end, which were somewhat overrepresented. The flanking regions in eukaryotes were clearly underrepresented among suitable oligonucleotides. In addition to distributions within genes, the effects on codon and amino acid usage were also studied.},

   abstract = {Progression to hormone-refractory growth of prostate cancer has been suggested to be mediated by androgen receptor (AR) gene alterations. We analyzed AR for mutations and amplifications in 21 locally recurrent prostate carcinomas treated with orchiectomy, estrogens, or a combination of orchiectomy and estramustine phosphate using fluorescence in situ hybridization, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and DNA sequence analyses. Amplification was observed in 4 of 16 (25%) and amino acid changing mutations was observed in 7 of 21 (33%) of the tumors, respectively. Two (50%) tumors with AR amplification also had missense mutation of the gene. Four of five (80%) cancers that were treated with a combination of orchiectomy and estramustine phosphate had a mutation clustered at codons 514 to 533 in the N-terminal domain of AR. In functional studies, these mutations did not render AR more sensitive to testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, or beta-estradiol. Tumors treated by orchiectomy had mutations predominantly in the ligand-binding domain. In summary, we found molecular alterations of AR in more than half of the prostate carcinomas that recurred locally. Some tumors developed both aberrations, possibly enhancing the cancer cell to respond efficiently to low levels of androgens. Furthermore, localization of point mutations in AR seems to be influenced by the type of treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main determinant of continuous peripheral nerve block effects--local anesthetic concentration and volume or simply total drug dose--remains unknown. METHODS: We compared two different concentrations and basal rates of ropivacaine--but at equivalent total doses--for continuous posterior lumbar plexus blocks after hip arthroplasty. Preoperatively, a psoas compartment perineural catheter was inserted. Postoperatively, patients were randomly assigned to receive perineural ropivacaine of either 0.1% (basal 12 ml/h, bolus 4 ml) or 0.4% (basal 3 ml/h, bolus 1 ml) for at least 48 h. Therefore, both groups received 12 mg of ropivacaine each hour with a possible addition of 4 mg every 30 min via a patient-controlled bolus dose. The primary endpoint was the difference in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the ipsilateral quadriceps the morning after surgery, compared with the preoperative MVIC, expressed as a percentage of the preoperative MVIC. Secondary endpoints included hip adductor and hip flexor MVIC, sensory levels in the femoral nerve distribution, hip range-of-motion, ambulatory ability, pain scores, and ropivacaine consumption. RESULTS: Quadriceps MVIC for patients receiving 0.1% ropivacaine (n = 26) declined by a mean (SE) of 64.1% (6.4) versus 68.0% (5.4) for patients receiving 0.4% ropivacaine (n = 24) between the preoperative period and the day after surgery (95% CI for group difference: -8.0-14.4%; P = 0.70). Similarly, the groups were found to be equivalent with respect to secondary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: For continuous posterior lumbar plexus blocks, local anesthetic concentration and volume do not influence nerve block characteristics, suggesting that local anesthetic dose (mass) is the primary determinant of perineural infusion effects.},

In this review, we discuss the current field of research on production and metabolic fates of isoprenoids in apicomplexan parasites, including the acquisition of host isoprenoid precursors and downstream products.

   abstract = {Treatment with the antimalarials chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine rarely causes retinopathy. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity are untreatable and can progress to legal blindness. Since 1957, there has been a consensus on the need to monitor patients on long-term chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine therapy. Currently, the procedure for follow-up includes collection of patient information, complete ophthalmological exam with automated central perimetry, and retinal electrophysiology. Screening should take place before treatment or no more than 6 months after initiation of antimalarial therapy. During treatment, monitoring relative to the baseline should be at a frequency determined by whether there are risk factors for development of toxicity, such as a cumulative dose greater than 1.8 kg, a daily dose greater than 6.5mg of hydroxychloroquine/kg/day, concurrent or past ophthalmological diseases, hepatic or renal insufficiency, age older than 65 years, and chloroquine intake. Retinopathy can occur in the absence of risk factors. The risk/benefit ratio favors therapy despite the time and expense of screening. Vigabatrin (VGB) is an effective drug for treatment of epilepsy and has been used in the treatment of West syndrome and epilepsy resistant to other drugs. VGB treatment improves quality of life, but it can induce characteristic bilateral nasal visual field defects and changes in retinal electrophysiology. Currently, the recommended procedure is to screen these patients before treatment, if possible, with a complete ophthalmological exam including perimetry and retinal electrophysiology every 6 months. It may be necessary to rely on retinal electrophysiology since some patients may not be able to undergo perimetry. The risk/benefit ratio sill clearly favors VGB treatment. Patients whose seizure incidence is reduced and have only minimal visual changes could continue VGB with strict monitoring. The others must discontinue VGB.},

However, if travel cannot be avoided, measures to prevent mosquito bites, along with an effective chemoprophylaxis regimen, should be implemented. Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are considered safe to use in all trimesters of pregnancy. Mefloquine is the agent of choice for chloroquine-resistant areas, and evidence suggests it is not associated with an increased risk to the fetus. Although the atovaquone-proguanil drug combination is not currently recommended for use during pregnancy, limited data suggest that it is not harmful to the fetus.

   abstract = {As a first step toward understanding the topology of the signal peptide with respect to the membrane during the protein export process, we have examined the constraints on the length of the cleavage region needed to achieve signal peptidase recognition and cleavage. Using the signal peptide of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, a series of cleavage region mutants has been constructed. Variations in length were brought about by replacing the wild type cleavage region of the signal peptide with polymers of increasingly more residues. In each case, alanine residues are used exclusively in the -1 and -3 positions to provide only one viable cleavage site. Glutamine residues are used in all other positions in order to vary the length from 3 to 13 total residues. Analysis of these mutants revealed that cleavage regions ranging from 3 to 9 residues are completely and efficiently processed. The extent of processing drops substantially thereafter, with no processing observed for signal peptides with 13-residue long cleavage regions. A second mutant with a 13-residue long cleavage region was designed and analyzed to ensure that the lack of processing reflected a cleavage problem and not a translocation defect. The results are consistent with the notion that the signal peptidase active site is in close proximity to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane and that interaction of the cleavage region with the signal peptidase probably depends on, and is constrained by, other interactions involving the signal peptide.},

   abstract = {The previous release of our Full-parasites database (http://fullmal.hgc.jp/) brought enhanced functionality, an expanded full-length cDNA content, and new RNA-Seq datasets from several important apicomplexan parasites. The 2015 update witnesses the major shift in the databases content with focus on diverse transcriptomes of the apicomplexan parasites. The content of the database was substantially enriched with transcriptome information for new apicomplexan parasites. The latest version covers a total of 17 species, with addition of our newly generated RNA-Seq data of a total of 909,150,388 tags. Moreover, we have generated and included two novel and unique datasets, which represent diverse nature of transcriptomes in individual parasites in vivo and in vitro. One is the data collected from 116 Indonesian patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The other is a series of transcriptome data collected from a total of 38 single cells of P. falciparum cultured in vitro. We believe that with the recent advances our database becomes an even better resource and a unique platform in the analysis of apicomplexan parasites and their interaction with their hosts. To adequately reflect the recent modifications and the current content we have changed the database name to DB-AT--DataBase of Apicomplexa Transcriptomes.},

Here, we address the possible nature of this association using plastid 'contamination' in fine-scale bacterial sequence surveys. In a transect between corals and associated macroalgae, ARL-V is specifically associated with the coral, in contrast to all microalgal types (including diatoms, haptophytes, pelagophytes and photosynthetic apicomplexan relatives, Chromera and Vitrella), which are associated with macroalgae. ARL-V is associated with at least 20 species of symbiotic corals through extended time periods and large geographic distances. It is significantly enriched in healthy coral tissue and shallow reef depths. Altogether, the evidence points to a specific relationship between ARL-V and corals, and is suggestive of symbiosis, perhaps based on photosynthesis.},

The exon-intron patterns generally reflect phylogeny based on amino acid sequences. However, close comparison of these gene structures reveals some striking features, such as the conservation of intron positions and intron phases between aspartyl proteinases from nematodes and apicomplexans. Here, we discuss the implications of gene structure for the possible evolution of the aspartyl proteinase family, with particular reference to the plasmepsins of Plasmodium falciparum and eimepsin from Eimeria tenella.},

   abstract = {The present review describes the development of synthetic cyclic peroxides, which are designed to surpass the antimalarial activity of the lead molecule, the natural product (+)-artemisinin and some of its C10 derivatives. To begin with, tricyclic and bicyclic 1,2,4-trioxanes are taken to show how the pharmacophore was identified and chirality proved to be irrelevant. The action of ferrous salts on trioxanes illustrates the structural elements that are needed so that reductive breaking of the peroxide bond leads to C-centered radicals, the alleged parasiticidal agents. Views are expressed on how heme, Plasmodium SERCA, and plain ferrous ions, either as targets or activators, could be implicated in the mode of action. Thereafter, news about 1,2,4-trioxolanes, 1,2,4-trioxanes, 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, 1,2-dioxolanes, and 1,2-dioxanes is recounted, emphasizing aspects of design, mechanism, and the importance of the adamantane entity for buttressing activity. News about compounds made up of a trioxane covalently bound to aminoquinoline, so-called hybrid molecules, is reported together with a view that they might be better than mechanical mixtures. No new antimalarial can be considered without a word about the risk posed by the parasite developing resistance. The review is not intended to be exhaustive. Some gaps prior to 2009 are filled in, while the later literature up to the end of July 2011 has been covered. Artemisinin and its derivatives fall outside the scope of the review. Nevertheless, some mechanistic insights garnered from artemisinin, which are relevant to synthetic peroxides, are included.},

Binding of aldolase to the adhesin was disrupted by mutation of a critical tryptophan in the C domain, a residue that was previously shown to be essential for parasite motility. Our findings reveal a potential role for aldolase in connecting TRAP family adhesins with the cytoskeleton, and provide a model linking adhesion with motility in apicomplexan parasites.},

All the mutations were different with the exception of three unrelated patients who all showed the same Arg-->His amino acid substitution (R641H) at a highly-conserved residue in the kinase domain.

SGA identifies patient groups with abnormal nutritional parameters, but may fail to identify patients with malnutrition as identified by other techniques, such as total body nitrogen. We sought to compare SGA with a composite nutritional score. METHODS: HD patients were assessed by SGA, anthropometry, 3-day food diary, serum albumin, Kt/V urea, and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). A composite nutritional score was derived from SGA, body mass index, percent of reference weight, triceps skinfold, midarm muscle circumference, and serum albumin. RESULTS: In 72 HD patients an abnormal SGA identified a patient group with reduced midarm circumference, midarm muscle circumference and serum creatinine and an increased composite nutritional score. However, overlap of nutritional scores was considerable between the normal and abnormal SGA groups, suggesting that SGA misclassified a large number of subjects. Serum albumin correlated with C-reactive protein (r = -0.473, P <.0001), not nutritional status. The composite nutritional score correlated with all of its components except for serum albumin. CONCLUSIONS: SGA may not reliably identify hemodialysis patients with abnormal nutrition. Serum albumin is related to inflammation and not to nutrition status.},

Post-immunization titers in the CPRV and HDCV groups reached 0.5 IU/ml (the WHO-recommended minimally acceptable titer) or greater in all subjects in both vaccine groups by day 14 and remained above that level through day 90. In the second study, 438 healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial and assigned to receive five doses from one of three lots of CPRV by intramuscular injection on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 in a simulated post-exposure prophylaxis regimen to evaluate lot consistency. Post-immunization titers rapidly increased to over 0.5 IU/ml by day 14 for all subjects and remained above that level through day 42 when the study was terminated. The three lots were considered equivalent. The percentage of subjects with at least one local reaction during the five-dose regimen was slightly lower in the CPRV group than in the HDCV group (P=0.06). The most frequently reported local reaction for all doses of vaccine was pain at the injection site. Headache, myalgia, and malaise were the most frequently reported systemic events. The percentage of subjects with at least one systemic event was significantly lower for CPRV (P=0.0084). No vaccine-related serious adverse reaction was reported in these studies. The results of these studies indicate that CPRV administered intramuscularly to healthy adults is immunogenic and is associated with fewer local and systemic reactions than HDCV.},

Positions of 13C magnetic resonances and UV absorption maxima of the above complexes and comparison with those of adenosine deaminase complexes strongly suggest that purine ribonucleoside is bound by adenosine deaminase as the 1,6 covalent hydrate, not as a covalently bonded complex formed by addition of a thiol group at the active site. The favorable position of equilibrium of the hydration reaction on the enzyme, together with its extremely unfavorable position in free solution, indicates that the effective activity of substrate water at the active site is in the neighborhood of 10(10) M. The Ki value of the active diastereomer of 6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside is estimated as 1.6 X 10(-13) M, more than 8 orders of magnitude lower than the apparent dissociation constants of enzyme complexes with the substrate adenosine or the product inosine. The enzyme's remarkable affinity for this hydrated species, which is vanishingly rare in free solution, seems understandable in terms of the hydrate's close resemblance to a hydrated intermediate approaching the transition state in direct water attack on adenosine.},

Here we show that human Csk is tyrosine phosphorylated in HeLa cells treated with sodium pervanadate. Phosphorylation in vivo occurs mainly at Tyr-184 and in vitro mainly at Tyr-304. A Y304F mutation strongly decreased Csk phosphorylation in vitro, and a Y184F mutation abolished tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. A catalytically inactive form of Csk was also phosphorylated on Tyr-184 in vivo, suggesting that this is not a site of autophosphorylation. The kinase activity of the Y184F protein was not changed, while the Y304F protein showed one-third of wild-type activity. Three-dimensional modelling of the Csk kinase domain indicated that the Y304F mutation abolishes one of two conserved hydrogen bonds between the upper and the lower lobes in the open conformation of the kinase domain. Phosphopeptide binding studies suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr-184 creates a binding site for low-molecular-mass proteins. Cellular Csk was associated with several phosphoproteins, some of which were interacting with the Csk SH2 domain. Taken together these results indicate that Csk can be phosphorylated in vivo at Tyr-184 by an as yet unknown tyrosine kinase, and that autophosphorylation of Tyr-304 occurs only at abnormally high Csk concentrations in vitro. Furthermore, Tyr-304 is required for the maintenance of the structure of the Csk kinase domain.},

   abstract = {In coeliac disease in the jejunum of a genetically susceptible person wheat gliadin and related prolamins from rye and barley trigger an immunological reaction, which induces small-bowel mucosal transformations, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. Though CD4+ specific T cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, infiltrating plasma cells and autoantibodies are known to have an effect on the coeliac disease, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the tissue injury remain to be elucidated. Our aim was to find novel gene transcripts, which might have a role in coeliac disease pathogenesis. The gene expression in duodenal biopsy samples from untreated coeliac patients (n=4), patients on gluten-free diet (n=4) and healthy controls (n=4) was studied by cDNA microarray analysis. The method allows monitoring of the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. Compared to healthy controls, the expression of 156 and 60 genes was changed in untreated and treated coeliac disease, respectively. Between treated and untreated coeliac disease, 98 genes had altered expression. Of the 5184 genes or expressed sequence tags, altogether 263 were affected. Many of these genes are directly or indirectly connected to T-cell activation, B-cell maturation or epithelial cell differentiation. By the microarray method, numerous genes were found to evince altered mRNA expression in coeliac disease. The method holds promise in exploring the pathogenetic mechanisms in the small bowel and may reveal new target genes for the therapy of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites possess a highly specialized secretory apparatus. The timed secretion of proteins from three different organelles--micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules--serves to establish and maintain a parasitophorous vacuole inside the host cell in which the parasites can divide. Recent efforts have identified components that sort apicomplexan proteins to these unusual secretory organelles and have shown that this machinery is evolutionarily conserved across species. Concise amino acid sequences (e.g. tyrosine-based motifs) within the targeted protein determine their destination in Apicomplexa in a way similar to mammalian cells. Additionally, the parasite exploits new or unusual mechanisms of protein targeting (e.g. post-secretory membrane insertion).},

   abstract = {Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) has recently been identified as a biomarker of prognostic significance and therapeutic potential for the treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma. This prompted us to establish a rapid and robust assay to determine deoxyhypusine and hypusine formed with the purified enzymes deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) from Plasmodium to develop a rapid screening assay for antimalarial drugs. The peptide hydrolysate obtained from hypusinylated eIF5A was analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with retention times for deoxyhypusine of 7.44 min and for hypusine of 7.30 min, respectively. The limit of detection for both compounds was 0.144 ng/mul. Determination of the specific activity of Plasmodium DOHH resulted in a twofold higher specific activity than its human counterpart. Following the iron-complexing strategy of the ferrous iron which is present in the active site of Plasmodium DOHH, a series of iron chelating compounds was tested. 2,2'-Dipyridyl and mimosine abolished DOHH activity completely while 4-oxo-piperidine-carboxylates i.e. the nitrophenylether JK8-2 and EHW 437, the oxime ether of the piperidine aldehyde, showed no inhibition although they were highly active in in vitro cultures of Plasmodium and in vivo in a rodent mouse model. The method allows a high-throughput screening (HPTS) of antimalarial drugs and the evaluation of eIF5A as a biomarker.},

   abstract = {An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1% to 3.9% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0% to 7.7%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of resistance to first line antimalarials led to recommendation of artemisinin based combination therapies (ACTs). High adherence to ACTs provided by community health workers (CHWs) gave reassurance that community based interventions did not increase the risk of drug resistance. Integrated community case management of illnesses (ICCM) is now recommended through which children will access both antibiotics and antimalarials from CHWs. Increased number of medicines has been shown to lower adherence. OBJECTIVE: To compare adherence to antimalarials alone versus antimalarials combined with antibiotics under ICCM in children less than five years. METHODS: A cohort study was nested within a cluster randomized trial that had CHWs treating children less than five years with antimalarials and antibiotics (intervention areas) and CHWs treating children with antimalarials only (control areas). Children were consecutively sampled from the CHWs' registers in the control areas (667 children); and intervention areas (323 taking antimalarials only and 266 taking antimalarials plus antibiotics). The sampled children were visited at home on day one and four of treatment seeking. Adherence was assessed using self reports and pill counts. RESULTS: Adherence in the intervention arm to antimalarials alone and antimalarials plus antibiotics arm was similar (mean 99% in both groups) but higher than adherence in the control arm (antimalarials only) (mean 96%). Forgetfulness (38%) was the most cited reason for non-adherence. At adjusted analysis: absence of fever (OR = 3.3, 95%CI =1.6-6.9), seeking care after two or more days (OR = 2.2, 95%CI = 1.3-3.7), not understanding instructions given (OR = 24.5, 95%CI = 2.7-224.5), vomiting (OR = 2.6, 95%CI = 1.2-5.5), and caregivers' perception that the child's illness was not severe (OR = 2.0, 95%CI = 1.1-3.8) were associated with non-adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of antibiotics to antimalarials did not lower adherence. However, caregivers should be adequately counseled to understand the dosing regimens; continue with medicines even when the child seems to improve; and re-administer doses that have been vomited.},

Furthermore, ring-B of PGs/TAs can be substituted with short alkyl substitutions at either 4-position (replacement of OMe) or 3- and 4-positions without impacting potency. Eight representative TAs and two PGs have been evaluated for antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant P. yoelii in mice in the dose range of 5-100 mg/kg x 4 days by oral administration. The KAR425 TA offered greater efficacy than previously observed for any PG, providing 100% protection to malaria-infected mice until day 28 at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg x 4 days, and was also curative in this model in a single oral dose (80 mg/kg).

In Plasmodium sporozoites, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP), a member of a group of Apicomplexan transmembrane proteins that have common adhesion domains, is necessary for gliding motility and infection of the vertebrate host. Here, we provide genetic evidence that TRAP is directly involved in a capping process that drives both sporozoite gliding and cell invasion. We also demonstrate that TRAP-related proteins in other Apicomplexa fulfill the same function and that their cytoplasmic tails interact with homologous partners in the respective parasite. Therefore, a mechanism of surface redistribution of TRAP-related proteins driving gliding locomotion and cell invasion is conserved among Apicomplexan parasites.},

   abstract = {The remarkable progress in characterizing the human genome sequence, exemplified by the Human Genome Project and the HapMap Consortium, has led to the perception that knowledge and the tools (e.g., microarrays) are sufficient for many if not most biomedical research efforts. A large amount of data from diverse studies proves this perception inaccurate at best, and at worst, an impediment for further efforts to characterize the variation in the human genome. Because variation in genotype and environment are the fundamental basis to understand phenotypic variability and heritability at the population level, identifying the range of human genetic variation is crucial to the development of personalized nutrition and medicine. The Human Variome Project (HVP; http://www.humanvariomeproject.org/) was proposed initially to systematically collect mutations that cause human disease and create a cyber infrastructure to link locus specific databases (LSDB). We report here the discussions and recommendations from the 2008 HVP planning meeting held in San Feliu de Guixols, Spain, in May 2008.},

   abstract = {Nebularine undergoes hydration at the active site of adenosine deaminase, in a reaction analogous to a partial reaction in the displacement of ammonia from adenosine by water, to generate an inhibitory complex that captures much of the binding affinity expected of an ideal transition-state analogue. Enzyme affinities of several compounds related to nebularine 1,6-hydrate, and to its stable analog 2'-deoxycoformycin, were compared in an effort to identify the structural origins of strong binding. Binding of the stable transition-state analog inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin was rendered 9.8 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of substituent ribose, 9.7 kcal/mol less favorable by inversion of the 8-hydroxyl substituent of the diazepine ring, and 10.0 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of atoms 4-6 of the diazepine ring. Binding of the unstable transition-state analog nebularine hydrate was rendered at least 9.9 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of the 6-hydroxyl group and 10.2 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of atoms 1-3 of the pyrimidine ring. In each case, the enzyme exhibited only modest affinity (Kd greater than or equal to 10(-2) M) for the "missing piece", indicating that incorporation of 2 binding determinants within a single molecule permits an additional 7-12 kcal/mol of intrinsic binding energy to be manifested as observed binding energy. These results are consistent with earlier indications that adenosine deaminase may use 10.5 kcal/mol of the intrinsic free energy of binding of the two substrates to place them in positions appropriate for reaction at the active site, overcoming the unfavorable entropy change of -35 eu for the equilibrium of 1,6-hydration of purine ribonucleoside and reducing the equilibrium constant for attainment of the transition state in deamination of adenosine. Thus, adenosine deaminase may achieve up to 8 orders of magnitude of its catalytic power by converting the nonenzymatic, bimolecular, hydration reaction to a monomolecular reaction at its active site. Several new 6-substituted 1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleosides, prepared by photoaddition of formate and by low-temperature addition of organolithium reagents to a derivative of purine ribonucleoside, exhibited Ki values of 9-1400 microM against adenosine deaminase, in accord with the active site's considerable tolerance of bulky leaving groups in substrates. Inhibition by one diastereomer of 6-carboxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside was found to be time-dependent, progressing from a weakly bound to a more strongly bound complex.},

   abstract = {Adenosine deaminase was found to bind 6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside (II), formed by reversible addition of water to purine ribonucleoside (I) in a reaction analogous to formation of a tetrahedral intermediate in substrate deamination, with an apparent Ki value of 3 x 10(-13) M at 20 degrees C. 1,6-Dihydropurine ribonucleoside (IV), synthesized by photolysis of purine ribonucleoside in the presence of NaBH4, exhibited a Ki value of 5.4 x 10-6 M. After correction for differences between the relative free energies of solvation of II and IV, the 6-hydroxyl group of II was estimated to contribute more than 16 kcal to the free energy of binding, approaching the enthalapy of formation of a single hydrogen bond to charged group in the vapor phase. The relatively weak binding of IV and of substrate water suggests that entropic effects, arising from the cooperative action of binding determinants contained within these separate molecules, contribute more than 10 kcal/mol to the free energy of binding of II in which these binding determinants are contained within a single molecule. In free solution, the entropy of reversible hydration of I was evaluated by measuring the temperature dependence of equilibria of protonation of I and of pseudobase formation from I-methylpurinium ribonucleoside as -35 eu, comparable with the entropy of activation for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of adenosine. In the active site of adenosine deaminase, this thermodynamic obstacle is evidently climbed spontaneously as a result of attractive interactions between the active site and the critical hydroxyl group at the 6-position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Whereas antimalarials have been in use to treat rheumatic disease for over 50 years, their exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Over the past decade, new theories have been proposed in this regard both for rheumatic disease, as well as related conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas the classical explanation was an impairment of phago/lysosomal function, antimalarials also appear to have an impact through inhibition of intracellular toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR9. This may mediate its effect on lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ancillary conditions including diabetes and hyperlipidemia. The potential role for antimalarials in antiphospholipid syndrome also appears clearer, with an effect proposed through Annexin5 binding. SUMMARY: Despite their established clinical utility, the mode of action for antimalarials remains uncertain despite recent advances and still requires further investigation. By better understanding how antimalarials function, their optimal use in the clinical setting can be ensured.},

   abstract = {Neospora caninum is a protozoan parasite which causes neurological problems in dogs and abortion in cattle. As N. caninum is difficult to distinguish morphologically from Toxoplasma gondii, we developed a molecular tool capable of discriminating between the two parasites. Genomic DNA was isolated from in vitro cultured N. caninum tachyzoites and cloned into a plasmid vector. Resulting colonies were subsequently screened by differential hybridization using N. caninum and T. gondii DNA. Two clones were characterized in detail: one clone, termed pNc5, was found to be specific for N. caninum whereas the second clone, pNc1, hybridized with DNA from both parasites. The sequence of pNc5 was determined and different oligonucleotide primers were designed for use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A 944 bp fragment was specifically amplified from N. caninum DNA, but not from DNA extracted from T. gondii or different Sarcocystis species. Positive signals in PCR were obtained with as little as 100 pg parasite template DNA. In addition, dual PCR with primer pairs specific for N. caninum and T. gondii allowed the detection of either parasite in mixed samples.},

New drugs with unique structures and mechanism of action are urgently required to treat sensitive and drug-resistant strains of malaria. Historically, compounds containing novel structure from natural origin represent a major source for the discovery and development of new drugs for several diseases. This review presents recent advances in antimalarial drug discovery from natural sources, including plant extracts, and compounds isolated from plants, bacteria, fungi and marine organisms. These compounds offer new and novel scaffolds for development as antimalarials. The literature from 1998 to October 2008 is reviewed.

Synovial cells were cultured with T-614 in the presence or absence of various cytokines. After incubation, the costimulatory molecule expression on synovial cells and cytokine production in culture supernatants were analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescence method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. We also examined the effect of T-614 on the function of synovial cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The costimulatory molecules including CD54, CD58, and CD106 were constitutionally expressed on the surface of synovial cells. However, neither CD80 nor CD86 nor CD102 was found on the surface, and these costimulatory molecules could not be induced by any cytokines. T-614 itself did not affect the costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production of unstimulated synovial cells. The stimulation of synovial cells with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-1beta, or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate enhanced the expression of costimulatory molecules and the proinflammatory cytokine production of these cells. Both the up-regulated expression of these costimulatory molecules and the enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly inhibited by T-614. Autologous T cell proliferation in response to purified protein derivative by IFN-gamma-treated synovial cells was significantly suppressed by T-614. T-614 has considerable immunosuppressive effects on synovial cells by inhibiting the costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production of these cells and the antigen-specific T cell proliferation mediated by the synovial cells. These results suggest that T-614 plays an important immunoregulatory role in rheumatoid synovial tissues.},

Here, we discuss the public health relevance of schistosomiasis, which is currently considered a neglected tropical disease. We recapitulate the past and current drug armamentarium against schistosomiasis, including shortcomings and a target product profile of an antischistosomal drug. The central piece of our review is the discovery of the antischistosomal properties of various antimalarial drugs, notably the artemisinins, synthetic trioxolanes, and mefloquine. We summarize findings from preclinical investigations and experiences made thus far from clinical studies. We conclude that a closer collaboration between the malaria and schistosomiasis communities might facilitate the discovery and development of novel antischistosomal drugs, and will foster monitoring and evaluation of the ancillary benefits of antimalarial prophylaxis and treatment against schistosomiasis.},

   abstract = {Rhoptries are club-shaped secretory organelles located at the anterior pole of species belonging to the phylum of Apicomplexa. Parasites of this phylum are responsible for a huge burden of disease in humans and animals and a loss of economic productivity. Members of this elite group of obligate intracellular parasites include Plasmodium spp. that cause malaria and Cryptosporidium spp. that cause diarrhoeal disease. Although rhoptries are almost ubiquitous throughout the phylum, the relevance and role of the proteins contained within the rhoptries varies. Rhoptry contents separate into two intra-organellar compartments, the neck and the bulb. A number of rhoptry neck proteins are conserved between species and are involved in functions such as host cell invasion. The bulb proteins are less well-conserved and probably evolved for a particular lifestyle. In the majority of species studied to date, rhoptry content is involved in formation and maintenance of the parasitophorous vacuole; however some species live free within the host cytoplasm. In this review, we will summarise the knowledge available regarding rhoptry proteins. Specifically, we will discuss the role of the rhoptry kinases that are used by Toxoplasma gondii and other coccidian parasites to subvert the host cellular functions and prevent parasite death.},

CONCLUSION: The signal peptide of Midkine is accessible to HLA class II pathway for CD4 T cell presentation. SIGNIFICANCE: It is a new function for signal peptides to contribute to tumor-specific CD4 T cell response. Because of the key role of CD4 T cell response in immunity to tumors, we investigated the CD4(+) T cell response to the recently identified tumor antigen Midkine (MDK). By weekly stimulations of T lymphocytes harvested from seven HLA-DR-typed healthy donors, we derived CD4(+) T cell lines specific for eight MDK peptides. Most of the T cell lines reacted with the peptides 9-23 and 14-28, located in and overlapping the MDK signal peptide, respectively. Accordingly, the MDK signal peptide appeared to be rich in good binders to common HLA-DR molecules. The peptide 9-23-specific T cell lines were specifically stimulated by autologous dendritic cells loaded with lysates of MDK-transfected cells or with lysates of tumor cells naturally expressing the MDK protein. One T cell line was stimulated by HLA-compatible MDK-transfected tumor cells. By contrast, the peptide 14-28-specific T cell lines were not stimulated in any of these conditions. Our data demonstrate that CD4(+) T cell epitopes present in the signal peptide can be accessible to recognition by CD4(+) T cells and may therefore contribute to tumor immunity, whereas a peptide overlapping the junction between the signal peptide and the mature protein is not.},

Chromera velia, the first discovered species, forms an independent photosynthetic lineage with V. brassicaformis, and both are closely related to peridinin-containing dinoflagellates and nonphotosynthetic apicomplexans; both also show phylogenetic closeness with red algal plastids. We have utilized gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify two free sterols, 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3beta-ol, and a minor unknown sterol which appeared to be a C28:4 compound. We have also used RNA Seq analysis to identify seven genes found in the nonmevalonate/methylerythritol pathway (MEP) for sterol biosynthesis. Subsequent genome analysis of V. brassicaformis showed the presence of two mevalonate (MVA) pathway genes, though the genes were not observed in the transcriptome analysis. Transcripts from four genes (dxr, ispf, ispd, and idi) were selected and translated into proteins to study the phylogenetic relationship of sterol biosynthesis in V. brassicaformis and C. velia to other groups of algae and apicomplexans. On the basis of our genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we hypothesize that the MEP pathway was the primary pathway that apicomplexans used for sterol biosynthesis before they lost their sterol biosynthesis ability, although contribution of the MVA pathway cannot be discounted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most genetic disorders are linked to missense mutations as even minor changes in the size or properties of an amino acid can alter or prevent the function of the protein. Further, the effect of a mutation is also dependent on the sequence and structure context of the alteration. RESULTS: We investigated the spectrum of disease-causing missense mutations in secondary structure elements in proteins with numerous known mutations and for which an experimentally defined three-dimensional structure is available. We obtained a comprehensive map of the differences in mutation frequencies, location and contact energies, and the changes in residue volume and charge - both in the mutated (original) amino acids and in the mutant amino acids in the different secondary structure types. We collected information for 44 different proteins involved in a large number of diseases. The studied proteins contained a total of 2413 mutations of which 1935 (80%) appeared in secondary structures. Differences in mutation patterns between secondary structures and whole proteins were generally not statistically significant whereas within the secondary structural elements numerous highly significant features were observed. CONCLUSION: Numerous trends in mutated and mutant amino acids are apparent. Among the original residues, arginine clearly has the highest relative mutability. The overall relative mutability among mutant residues is highest for cysteine and tryptophan. The mutability values are higher for mutated residues than for mutant residues. Arginine and glycine are among the most mutated residues in all secondary structures whereas the other amino acids have large variations in mutability between structure types. Statistical analysis was used to reveal trends in different secondary structural elements, residue types as well as for the charge and volume changes.},

   abstract = {In order to study protein function and activity structural data is required. Since experimental structures are available for just a small fraction of all known protein sequences, computational methods such as protein modelling can provide useful information. Over the last few decades we have predicted, with homology modelling methods, the structures for numerous proteins. In this study we assess the structural quality and validity of the biological and medical interpretations and predictions made based on the models. All the models had correct scaffolding and were ranked at least as correct or good by numerical evaluators even though the sequence identity with the template was as low as 8%. The biological explanations made based on models were well in line with experimental structures and other experimental studies. Retrospective analysis of homology models indicates the power of protein modelling when made carefully from sequence alignment to model building and refinement. Modelling can be applied to studying and predicting different kinds of biological phenomena and according to our results it can be done so with success.},

Stability predictors computationally predict protein-stability changes caused by mutations. We performed a systematic analysis of 11 online stability predictors' performances. These predictors are CUPSAT, Dmutant, FoldX, I-Mutant2.0, two versions of I-Mutant3.0 (sequence and structure versions), MultiMutate, MUpro, SCide, Scpred, and SRide. As input, 1,784 single mutations found in 80 proteins were used, and these mutations did not include those used for training. The programs' performances were also assessed according to where the mutations were found in the proteins, that is, in secondary structures and on the surface or in the core of a protein, and according to protein structure type. The extents to which the mutations altered the occupied volumes at the residue sites and the charge interactions were also characterized. The predictions of all programs were in line with the experimental data. I-Mutant3.0 (utilizing structural information), Dmutant, and FoldX were the most reliable predictors. The stability-center predictors performed with similar accuracy. However, at best, the predictions were only moderately accurate ( approximately 60%) and significantly better tools would be needed for routine analysis of mutation effects.},

   abstract = {EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway has an established role in promoting malignant growth and disease progression in human cancers. Therefore identification of transcriptional targets mediating the oncogenic effects of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway would be highly relevant. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is a recently characterized human oncoprotein. CIP2A promotes malignant cell growth and is over expressed at high frequency (40-80%) in most of the human cancer types. However, the mechanisms inducing its expression in cancer still remain largely unexplored. Here we present systematic analysis of contribution of potential gene regulatory mechanisms for high CIP2A expression in cancer. Our data shows that evolutionary conserved CpG islands at the proximal CIP2A promoter are not methylated both in normal and cancer cells. Furthermore, sequencing of the active CIP2A promoter region from altogether seven normal and malignant cell types did not reveal any sequence alterations that would increase CIP2A expression specifically in cancer cells. However, treatment of cancer cells with various signaling pathway inhibitors revealed that CIP2A mRNA expression was sensitive to inhibition of EGFR activity as well as inhibition or activation of MEK-ERK pathway. Moreover, MEK1/2-specific siRNAs decreased CIP2A protein expression. Series of CIP2A promoter-luciferase constructs were created to identify proximal -27 to -107 promoter region responsible for MEK-dependent stimulation of CIP2A expression. Additional mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed ETS1 as the transcription factor mediating stimulation of CIP2A expression through EGFR-MEK pathway. Thus, ETS1 is probably mediating high CIP2A expression in human cancers with increased EGFR-MEK1/2-ERK pathway activity. These results also suggest that in addition to its established role in invasion and angiogenesis, ETS1 may support malignant cellular growth via regulation of CIP2A expression and protein phosphatase 2A inhibition.},

We determined the prevalence, clinical features, and spectrum of bacteremia among febrile children younger than 5 years of age admitted with a negative malaria test, but prescribed antimalarials at a referral hospital in Jinja, Uganda. After initial evaluation, a blood sample was drawn from 250 children for a complete blood count and bacterial culture. Of 250 samples cultured, 15 grew organisms presumed to be skin contaminants, and of the remaining 235 samples, 45 (19.1%) had bacteremia. Staphylococcus aureus (42%), non-typhoidal Salmonella (24%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%) were the most common bacterial isolates. On multivariate analysis, history of weight loss (odds ratio [OR] = 2.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-5.95), presence of pulmonary crackles (OR = 3.63; 95% CI = 1.40-9.45), and leukocytosis (OR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.09-4.47) were independent predictors of bacteremia.

Our method was applied to time course datasets individually for each time point. We derived from sequence information numerous parameters for nucleotide composition, two-base composition, codon usage, skew parameters, and codon bias. In addition to coding regions, we also investigated correlations for complete genes and introns. Significant dynamic correlations were identified for each of the analyses. Our method also proved useful for detecting dynamic shifts in gene expression profiles, such as in the D. melanogaster dataset. Detection of changes in the properties of expressed genes and proteins might be useful for predicting or following biological processes, responses, growth, differentiation and possibly in related disorders.},

Recent work has demonstrated divergent aspects of canonical eukaryotic components in the Apicomplexa, including Golgi bodies and mitochondria. The apicoplast is a relict plastid of secondary endosymbiotic origin, harboring metabolic pathways distinct from those of host species. The inner membrane complex (IMC) is derived from the cortical alveoli defining the superphylum Alveolata, but in apicomplexans functions in parasite motility and replication. Micronemes and rhoptries are associated with establishment of the intracellular niche, and define the apical complex for which the phylum is named. Morphological, cell biological and molecular evidence strongly suggest that these organelles are derived from the endocytic pathway.},

   abstract = {The thermal unfolding of three SH3 domains of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and CD spectroscopy. The unfolding transition of the three protein domains in the acidic pH region can be described as a reversible two-state process. For all three SH3 domains maximum stability was observed in the pH region 4.5 < pH < 7.0 where these domains unfold at temperatures of 353K (Btk), 342K (Itk), and 344K (Tec). At these temperatures an enthalpy change of 196 kJ/mol, 178 kJ/mol, and 169 kJ/mol was measured for Btk-, Itk-, and Tec-SH3 domains, respectively. The determined changes in heat capacity between the native and the denatured state are in an usual range expected for small proteins. Our analysis revealed that all SH3 domains studied are only weakly stabilized and have free energies of unfolding which do not exceed 12-16 kJ/mol but show quite high melting temperatures. Comparing unfolding free energies measured for eukaryotic SH3 domains with those of the topologically identical Sso7d protein from the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus, the increased melting temperature of the thermostable protein is due to a broadening as well as a significant lifting of its stability curve. However, at their physiological temperatures, 310K for mesophilic SH3 domains and 350K for Sso7d, eukaryotic SH3 domains and Sso7d show very similar stabilities.},

   abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR)-interacting protein 3 (ARIP3/PIASxalpha) is a coregulator capable of modulating transcriptional activity of various steroid receptors. We have characterized functional regions of ARIP3 and studied its interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1). We find that the potential zinc-binding domain is critical for ARIP3 to function as a coactivator; the deletion of amino acids 347-418 or the mutation of the conserved cysteines 385 and 388 to serines converts ARIP3 to a transcriptional repressor from AR-dependent minimal promoters and abolishes its ability to activate GR. By contrast, mutations in the two LXXLL motifs of ARIP3 have relatively minor effects on its ability to regulate AR or GR function. ARIP3 is able to interact with different regions of GRIP1, but the strongest interaction is detected with the C-terminal region (amino acids 1122-1462) of GRIP1. The interaction of ARIP3 with the latter GRIP1 domain or full-length GRIP1 and the ability of ARIP3 to cooperate with GRIP1 in the regulation of AR- or GR-dependent transcription are dependent on the ARIP3 zinc-binding region. We also find a strong synergism between GRIP1 and two other PIAS family members, Miz1 and PIAS1. Taken together, our results suggest that PIAS proteins and GRIP1 interact functionally in transcriptional regulation.},

   abstract = {The search for new antimalarials, which in the past relied on animal models, is now usually performed with cultures of Plasmodium falciparum (PF) blood parasites by evaluation of parasite growth inhibition. Field isolates of PF human malaria parasite, parasite strains and clones, well characterized for their susceptibility to chloroquine and other standard antimalarials are available for the in vitro tests. The simplest method to evaluate parasite growth is the determination of parasitemias in Giemsa stained blood smears through light microscopy. Other methodologies have proven to be more precise and allow mass screening of new compounds against PF blood stages, such as: (i) measuring the incorporation of radioactive hypoxanthine by the parasites; (ii) indirect colorimetric assays in which specific parasite enzyme activities, and histidine-rich protein II (HRP2) production are measured with the help of monoclonal antibodies; (iii) the beta-haematin formation, and; (iv) assays using green fluorescent protein (GFP) in gene-expressing parasites. The advantages and disadvantages of the different in vitro screening methods, as well as the different in vivo models for antimalarial tests, are described in this review. Such tests can be used for the evaluation of medicinal plants, synthetic and hybrid molecules or drug combinations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyclophilins (Cyps) are peptidyl cis/trans isomerases implicated in diverse processes such as protein folding, signal transduction, and RNA processing. They are also candidate drug targets, in particular for the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A. In addition, cyclosporine is known to exhibit anti-parasitic effects on a wide range of organisms including several apicomplexa. In order to obtain new non-immunosuppressive drugs targeting apicomplexan cyclophilins, a profound knowledge of the cyclophilin repertoire of this phylum would be necessary. RESULTS: BLAST and maximum likelihood analyses identified 16 different cyclophilin subfamilies within the genomes of Cryptosporidium hominis, Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Theileria annulata, Theileria parva, and Babesia bovis. In addition to good statistical support from the phylogenetic analysis, these subfamilies are also confirmed by comparison of cyclophilin domain architecture. Within an individual genome, the number of different Cyp genes that could be deduced varies between 7-9 for Cryptosporidia and 14 for T. gondii. Many of the putative apicomplexan cyclophilins are predicted to be nuclear proteins, most of them presumably involved in RNA processing. CONCLUSION: The genomes of apicomplexa harbor a cyclophilin repertoire that is at least as complex as that of most fungi. The identification of Cyp subfamilies that are specific for lower eukaryotes, apicomplexa, or even the genus Plasmodium is of particular interest since these subfamilies are not present in host cells and might therefore represent attractive drug targets.},

   abstract = {Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and other volatile strong acids, used as modifiers in reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, cause signal suppression for basic compounds when analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Evidence is presented that signal suppression is caused by strong ion pairing between the TFA anion and the protonated sample cation of basic sample molecules. The ion-pairing process "masks" the protonated sample cations from the ESI-MS electric fields by rendering them "neutral. " Weakly basic molecules are not suppressed by this process. The TFA signal suppression effect is independent from the well-known spray problem that electrospray has with highly aqueous solutions that contain TFA. This previously reported spray problem is caused by the high conductivity and surface tension of aqueous TFA solutions. A practical method to enhance the signal for most basic analytes in the presence of signal-suppressing volatile strong acids has been developed. The method employs postcolumn addition of a solution of 75% propionic acid and 25% isopropanol in a ratio 1:2 to the column flow. Signal enhancement is typically 10-50 times for peptides and other small basic molecules. Thus, peptide maps that use ESI-MS for detection can be performed at lower levels, with conventional columns, without the need to use capillary chromatography or reduced mass spectral resolution to achieve satisfactory sensitivity. The method may be used with similar results for heptafluorobutyric acid and hydrochloric acid. A mechanism for TFA signal suppression and signal enhancement by the foregoing method, is proposed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lineage-specific genes, the genes that are restricted to a limited subset of related organisms, may be important in adaptation. In parasitic organisms, lineage-specific gene products are possible targets for vaccine development or therapeutics when these genes are absent from the host genome. RESULTS: In this study, we utilized comparative approaches based on a phylogenetic framework to characterize lineage-specific genes in the parasitic protozoan phylum Apicomplexa. Genes from species in two major apicomplexan genera, Plasmodium and Theileria, were categorized into six levels of lineage specificity based on a nine-species phylogeny. In both genera, lineage-specific genes tend to have a higher level of sequence divergence among sister species. In addition, species-specific genes possess a strong codon usage bias compared to other genes in the genome. We found that a large number of genus- or species-specific genes are putative surface antigens that may be involved in host-parasite interactions. Interestingly, the two parasite lineages exhibit several notable differences. In Plasmodium, the (G + C) content at the third codon position increases with lineage specificity while Theileria shows the opposite trend. Surface antigens in Plasmodium are species-specific and mainly located in sub-telomeric regions. In contrast, surface antigens in Theileria are conserved at the genus level and distributed across the entire lengths of chromosomes. CONCLUSION: Our results provide further support for the model that gene duplication followed by rapid divergence is a major mechanism for generating lineage-specific genes. The result that many lineage-specific genes are putative surface antigens supports the hypothesis that lineage-specific genes could be important in parasite adaptation. The contrasting properties between the lineage-specific genes in two major apicomplexan genera indicate that the mechanisms of generating lineage-specific genes and the subsequent evolutionary fates can differ between related parasite lineages. Future studies that focus on improving functional annotation of parasite genomes and collection of genetic variation data at within- and between-species levels will be important in facilitating our understanding of parasite adaptation and natural selection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inherited factors predisposing individuals to breast and ovarian cancer are largely unidentified in a majority of families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). We aimed to identify germline copy number variations (CNVs) contributing to HBOC susceptibility in the Finnish population. METHODS: A cohort of 84 HBOC individuals (negative for BRCA1/2-founder mutations and pre-screened for the most common breast cancer genes) and 36 healthy controls were analysed with a genome-wide SNP array. CNV-affecting genes were further studied by Gene Ontology term enrichment, pathway analyses, and database searches to reveal genes with potential for breast and ovarian cancer predisposition. CNVs that were considered to be important were validated and genotyped in 20 additional HBOC individuals (6 CNVs) and in additional healthy controls (5 CNVs) by qPCR. RESULTS: An intronic deletion in the EPHA3 receptor tyrosine kinase was enriched in HBOC individuals (12 of 101, 11.9%) compared with controls (27 of 432, 6.3%) (OR = 1.96; P = 0.055). EPHA3 was identified in several enriched molecular functions including receptor activity. Both a novel intronic deletion in the CSMD1 tumor suppressor gene and a homozygous intergenic deletion at 5q15 were identified in 1 of 101 (1.0%) HBOC individuals but were very rare (1 of 436, 0.2% and 1 of 899, 0.1%, respectively) in healthy controls suggesting that these variants confer disease susceptibility. CONCLUSION: This study reveals new information regarding the germline CNVs that likely contribute to HBOC susceptibility in Finland. This information may be used to facilitate the genetic counselling of HBOC individuals but the preliminary results warrant additional studies of a larger study group.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Two major high-penetrance breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are responsible for approximately 20% of hereditary breast cancer (HBC) cases in Finland. Additionally, rare mutations in several other genes that interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of HBC. Still, a majority of HBC cases remain unexplained which is challenging for genetic counseling. We aimed to analyze additional mutations in HBC-associated genes and to define the sensitivity of our current BRCA1/2 mutation analysis protocol used in genetic counseling. METHODS: Eighty-two well-characterized, high-risk hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals, were screened for germline alterations in seven breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, BRIP1, RAD50, and CDH1. BRCA1/2 were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and direct sequencing. CHEK2 was analyzed by the high resolution melt (HRM) method and PALB2, RAD50, BRIP1 and CDH1 were analyzed by direct sequencing. Carrier frequencies between 82 (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals and 384 healthy Finnish population controls were compared by using Fisher's exact test. In silico prediction for novel missense variants effects was carried out by using Pathogenic-Or-Not -Pipeline (PON-P). RESULTS: Three previously reported breast cancer-associated variants, BRCA1 c.5095C > T, CHEK2 c.470T > C, and CHEK2 c.1100delC, were observed in eleven (13.4%) individuals. Ten of these individuals (12.2%) had CHEK2 variants, c.470T > C and/or c.1100delC. Fourteen novel sequence alterations and nine individuals with more than one non-synonymous variant were identified. One of the novel variants, BRCA2 c.72A > T (Leu24Phe) was predicted to be likely pathogenic in silico. No large genomic rearrangements were detected in BRCA1/2 by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, mutations in previously known breast cancer susceptibility genes can explain 13.4% of the analyzed high-risk BRCA1/2-negative HBOC individuals. CHEK2 mutations, c.470T > C and c.1100delC, make a considerable contribution (12.2%) to these high-risk individuals but further segregation analysis is needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these mutations before applying them in clinical use. Additionally, we identified novel variants that warrant additional studies. Our current genetic testing protocol for 28 Finnish BRCA1/2-founder mutations and protein truncation test (PTT) of the largest exons is sensitive enough for clinical use as a primary screening tool.},

The rate of spontaneous hydrolysis of phenyl phosphate dianion indicates that a linear free energy relationship reported earlier is reliable for leaving groups whose conjugate acids have pKa values up to at least 10. Using Teflon reaction vessels, it proved possible to follow the hydrolysis of methyl phosphate and 3-(4-carboxy)-2,2-dimethylpropyl phosphate in strong alkali. Even in 1 M KOH, the reaction was found to be specific acid catalyzed. These results establish an upper limit for dianion reactivity, which had been overestimated earlier as a result of the leaching by alkali of silicic acid from quartz reaction vessels. The present findings indicate that the half-time for attack by water on alkyl phosphate dianions is 1.1 x 10(12) years (k = 2 x 10(-20) s) at 25 degrees C and that phosphatases involved in cell signaling and regulation produce the largest rate enhancements that have been identified thus far.

These characteristics, calculated from multiple positions in a sequence, may be conserved even between sequences that fail to produce alignments at any acceptable level of statistical significance. PHYSEAN complements methods that require sequence alignments (BLAST, FASTA, dynamic programming) by adding less residue- and position-specific physicochemical information on the protein or the domain. RESULTS: We predict proteins or their domains like signal peptides using physical, chemical, geometric, and biological properties of the 20 amino acids. This comprehensive set of properties may cover the diagnostic functional and structural aspects of a domain or a protein class. We automatically select and weight a subset of properties so as to discriminate between, e.g., signal peptides and amino-termini of cytosolic proteins with the lowest number of incorrect predictions. This optimal selection of properties and their weights significantly decreases the number of incorrect predictions as compared to any single property or any combination of unweighted properties. Weights have been optimized by high-performance linear programming models that systematically find the optimal solution from among an astronomic number of property/weight combinations. PHYSEAN's performance is demonstrated by highly accurate predictions of signal peptides (the vehicles for protein transport across membranes) and their cleavage sites. The results indicate reliable predictions are possible even in the lack of sequence conservation using an automated physical and chemical analysis of proteins.},

Insecticide treated nets (ITN) and antimalarials are the two proven interventions for prevention and control of malaria. ITN has been amply demonstrated to be an effective intervention to protect children from malaria, and in preventing deaths due to falciparum malaria. Antimalarials are a therapeutic intervention for management of malaria, and prevention of complications due to Plasmodium falciparum infection. However, implementation of these interventions is fraught with problems of complex and multidimensional nature at the periphery.

A total of 7,740 individual and packaged tablets, ampoules, and syrups were obtained from 60 randomly selected public (N = 35) and private outlets (N = 25) in Afghanistan. Of these, 134 samples were screened using the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF) MiniLab(R) in Kabul with 33/126 (26%) samples failing the MiniLab(R) disintegration test. The quality of a subsample (N = 37) of cholorquine, quinine, and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine tablets was assessed by in vitro dissolution testing following U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) monographs at a bioanalytical laboratory in London, United Kingdom. Overall, 12/32 (32%) samples of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and quinine were found not to comply with the USP tolerance limits. Substandard antimalarials were available in Afghanistan demonstrating that continuous monitoring of drug quality is warranted. However, in Afghanistan as in many low-income countries, capacity to determine and monitor drug quality using methods such as dissolution testing needs to be established to empower national authorities to take appropriate action in setting up legislation and regulation.},

   abstract = {Obligate intracellular Apicomplexa parasites share a unique invasion mechanism involving a tight interaction between the host cell and the parasite surfaces called the moving junction (MJ). The MJ, which is the anchoring structure for the invasion process, is formed by secretion of a macromolecular complex (RON2/4/5/8), derived from secretory organelles called rhoptries, into the host cell membrane. AMA1, a protein secreted from micronemes and associated with the parasite surface during invasion, has been shown in vitro to bind the MJ complex through a direct association with RON2. Here we show that RON2 is inserted as an integral membrane protein in the host cell and, using several interaction assays with native or recombinant proteins, we define the region that binds AMA1. Our studies were performed both in Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum and although AMA1 and RON2 proteins have diverged between Apicomplexa species, we show an intra-species conservation of their interaction. More importantly, invasion inhibition assays using recombinant proteins demonstrate that the RON2-AMA1 interaction is crucial for both T. gondii and P. falciparum entry into their host cells. This work provides the first evidence that AMA1 uses the rhoptry neck protein RON2 as a receptor to promote invasion by Apicomplexa parasites.},

The NPL structure seems to consist of a central (alpha/beta)8 barrel to which the other domains are attached. The immediate surroundings of the NPL catalytic site were found to have very similar structure to TAA. The more distant sites are different due to the stereochemical requirements of accommodating in the substrate alpha-1,6-linkages at every third position instead of alpha-1,4-linkages. The substrate binding cleft is wider than in alpha-amylases. The NPL structure, function, substrate binding and the consequences of mutations were discussed based on the modeled structure.},

Three-dimensional models for the anti-estradiol antibody 57-2 were constructed by comparative model building. Estradiol and analogs were docked into the combining site and molecular dynamics simulation was used to further refine this area of the protein. Cross-reactivities measured against 36 steroid analogs were used to help in the docking process and to evaluate the models. The roles of a number of residues were assessed by characterization of cross-reactivity mutants obtained from a phage display library. The cross-reactivity data and the results observed for mutants are explained by the structural model, in which the estradiol D-ring inserts deeply into the binding site and interacts with the antibody through at least one specific hydrogen bond. The binding data strongly suggest that this hydrogen bond connects the estradiol 17-hydroxyl group with the side chain of Gln H35. As expected for the binding of a small aromatic molecule, the antibody binding site contains many aromatic residues, e.g. Trp H50, H95 and L96 and Tyr L32, L49 and Phe L91.},

These genes are of particular interest in the protozoan phylum Apicomplexa, since a family of Rab GTPases has been described for Plasmodium and most putative secretory pathway proteins in Apicomplexa have conventional predicted signal peptides. Moreover, peptide motifs have now been identified within a large number of secreted Plasmodium proteins that direct their targeting to the red blood cell cytosol, the apicoplast, the food vacuole and Maurer's clefs; in contrast, motifs that direct proteins to secretory organelles (rhoptries, micronemes and microspheres) have yet to be defined. The nature of the vesicle in which these proteins are transported to their destinations remains unknown and morphological structures equivalent to the endoplasmic reticulum and trans-Golgi stacks typical of other eukaryotes cannot be visualised in Apicomplexa. Since Rab GTPases regulate vesicular traffic in all eukaryotes, and this traffic in intracellular parasites could regulate import of nutrient and drugs and export of antigens, host cell modulatory proteins and lactate we compare and contrast here the Rab families of Apicomplexa.},

The order of potency and geometric mean (GM) 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were as follows: artemisone (2.40 nM) > artesunate (8.49 nM) > dihydroartemisinin (11.26 nM) > artemiside (15.28 nM) > OZ277 (31.25 nM) > OZ78 (755.27 nM). Ex vivo activities of test endoperoxides positively correlated with dihydroartemisinin and artesunate. The isolates were over 2-fold less susceptible to dihydroartemisinin than the artemisinin-sensitive P. falciparum W2 clone and showed sensitivity comparable to those with test endoperoxides and artesunate, with isolate/W2 IC50 susceptibility ratios of <2.0. All isolates had P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter mutations, with negative correlations in sensitivity to endoperoxides and chloroquine. The activities of endoperoxides (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, OZ277, and artemisone) significantly correlated with that of the ACT partner drug, mefloquine. Isolates had mutations associated with clinical resistance to mefloquine, with 35% prevalence of P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1) amplification and 84.5% occurrence of the pfmdr1 Y184F mutation. GM IC50s for mefloquine, lumefantrine, and endoperoxides (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, OZ277, OZ78, and artemisone) correlated with pfmdr1 copy number. Given that current ACTs are failing potentially from reduced sensitivity to artemisinins and partner drugs, newly identified mutations associated with artemisinin resistance reported in the literature and pfmdr1 mutations should be examined for their combined contributions to emerging ACT resistance.},

   abstract = {CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) cross-talk plays a key role in B-cell terminal maturation in the germinal centers. Genetic defects affecting CD40 cause a rare form of hyper-immunoglobulin M (IgM) syndrome, a disorder characterized by low or absent serum IgG and IgA, associated with recurrent infections. We previously reported on a few patients with homozygous CD40 mutations resulting in lack or severe reduction of CD40 cell surface expression. Here we characterize the 3 CD40 mutants due to missense mutations or small in-frame deletions, and show that the mutated proteins are synthesized but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), likely due to protein misfolding. Interestingly, the intracellular behavior and fate differ significantly among the mutants: progressive accumulation of the P2 mutant causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and the activation of an unfolded protein response; the mutant P4 is rather efficiently disposed by the ER-associated degradation pathway, while the P5 mutant partially negotiates transport to the plasma membrane, and is competent for CD40L binding. Interestingly, this latter mutant activates downstream signaling elements when overexpressed in transfected cells. These results give new important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HIGM disease, and suggest that CD40 deficiency can also be regarded as an ER-storage disease.},

A variety of SH2D1A gene mutations have been reported thus far in XLP males. Here we describe a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay for mutation analysis in XLP. Four novel patients with SH2D1A mutations are described. These mutants, and the others previously reported in the literature, have been included in a Registry (SH2D1Abase) that is fully accessible on the World Wide Web. A three-dimensional model of the SH2 domain of the SH2D1A protein has been developed, based on homology with other SH2 domains.

Mutations in the BTK, SH2D1A, ZAP70, STAT1, and STAT5B genes have been shown to cause diverse immunodeficiencies, whereas the mutations in RASA1 and PIK3R1 genes lead to basal carcinoma and diabetes, respectively. PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan sydrome and different types of cancer, depending mainly on whether the mutation is inherited or sporadic. We collected and analyzed all known pathogenic mutations affecting human SH2 domains by bioinformatics methods. Among the investigated protein properties are sequence conservation and covariance, structural stability, side chain rotamers, packing effects, surface electrostatics, hydrogen bond formation, accessible surface area, salt bridges, and residue contacts. The majority of the mutations affect positions essential for phosphotyrosine ligand binding and specificity.

To analyse the protein structure and consequences of ICF-causing mutations, we modelled the structure of the DNMT3B methyltransferase domain based on Haemophilus haemolyticus protein in complex with the cofactor AdoMet and the target DNA sequence. The structural model has a two-subdomain fold where the DNA-binding region is situated between the subdomains on a surface cleft having positive electrostatic potential. The smaller subdomains of the methyltransferases differ in length and sequences and therefore only the target recognition domain loop was modelled to show the location of an ICF-causing mutation. Based on the model, the DNMT3B recognizes the GC sequence and flips the cytosine from the double-stranded DNA to the catalytic pocket. The amino acids in the cofactor and target cytosine binding sites and also the electrostatic properties of the binding pockets are conserved. In addition, a registry of all known ICF-causing mutations, DNMT3Bbase, was constructed. The structural principles of the pathogenic mutations based on the modelled structure and the analysis of chi angle rotation changes of mutated side chains are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Translocation-associated gene fusions are well recognized in acute myeloid leukemia. Other molecular genetic changes are less well known. The novel cDNA technology has opened the avenue to large-scale gene expression analysis. Our aim was to perform cDNA microarray analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed cDNA microarray analysis using the Clontech hematology filter (containing 406 genes) on 15 patients to study gene expression profiling in AML. As reference, we used whole bone marrow from 5 healthy donors. RESULTS: Our results revealed 50 differentially expressed genes in at least 3 out of 15 patients. Twenty-two genes were upregulated (ratio > or =4), whereas 28 genes were downregulated (ratio < or =0.25). All but one of the 13 genes tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed the same expression profiles. Among the overexpressed genes, several were those earlier associated with chromosomal translocations and gene fusions. These genes were FGFR1, MYC, NPM1, DEC, and BCL2. The expression of two upregulated genes, HOXA4 and CSF1R, was significantly higher in patients with a white blood cell count higher than 30 x 10(9)/L cells. In patients whose white blood cell count was higher than 100 x 10(9)/L cells, both CLC and GRN were significantly underexpressed, whereas HOXA4 and DAPK1 were overexpressed. FGFR1 and CAMLG were more frequently significantly overexpressed in patients with CD56 immunophenoytpe. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and prognostic significance of differential gene expression should be studied with a larger series of patients by using other techniques, such as quantitative real-time PCR.},

   abstract = {The benefits of laparoscopic hysterectomy are well documented and include less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and faster recovery. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of laparoscopic hysterectomy as an outpatient procedure. A total of 26 women regarded eligible for an accelerated approach were included. The mean duration of the operation was 40 min (range 23-60 min), with a blood loss of 50 mL (range 10-200 mL). Twenty-three left the hospital the same day (88%). One woman required overnight hospitalization because of a port hematoma, while two stayed for reasons unrelated to the surgery. Three other women were referred with minor problems to an urgent clinic appointment within the first month. Overall, the women were satisfied with the procedure, with a mean rating of 9 of 10 possible points. Thus, outpatient laparoscopic hysterectomy appeared to be safe and well accepted by selected patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic cells contain numerous compartments, which have different protein constituents. Proteins are typically directed to compartments by short peptide sequences that act as targeting signals. Translocation to the proper compartment allows a protein to form the necessary interactions with its partners and take part in biological networks such as signalling and metabolic pathways. If a protein is not transported to the correct intracellular compartment either the reaction performed or information carried by the protein does not reach the proper site, causing either inactivation of central reactions or misregulation of signalling cascades, or the mislocalized active protein has harmful effects by acting in the wrong place. RESULTS: Numerous methods have been developed to predict protein subcellular localization with quite high accuracy. We applied bioinformatics methods to investigate the effects of known disease-related mutations on protein targeting and localization by analyzing over 22,000 missense mutations in more than 1,500 proteins with two complementary prediction approaches. Several hundred putative localization affecting mutations were identified and investigated statistically. CONCLUSION: Although alterations to localization signals are rare, these effects should be taken into account when analyzing the consequences of disease-related mutations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recombination-activating gene (RAG) 1/2 proteins play a critical role in the development of T and B cells by initiating the VDJ recombination process that leads to generation of a broad T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor repertoire. Pathogenic mutations in the RAG1/2 genes result in various forms of primary immunodeficiency, ranging from T(-)B(-) severe combined immune deficiency to delayed-onset disease with granuloma formation, autoimmunity, or both. It is not clear what contributes to such heterogeneity of phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the molecular basis for phenotypic diversity presented in patients with various RAG1 mutations. METHODS: We have developed a flow cytometry-based assay that allows analysis of RAG recombination activity based on green fluorescent protein expression and have assessed the induction of the Ighc locus rearrangements in mouse Rag1(-/-) pro-B cells reconstituted with wild-type or mutant human RAG1 (hRAG1) using deep sequencing technology. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate correlation between defective recombination activity of hRAG1 mutant proteins and severity of the clinical and immunologic phenotype and provide insights on the molecular mechanisms accounting for such phenotypic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Using a sensitive assay to measure the RAG1 activity level of 79 mutations in a physiologic setting, we demonstrate correlation between recombination activity of RAG1 mutants and the severity of clinical presentation and show that RAG1 mutants can induce specific abnormalities of the VDJ recombination process.},

Four compounds (DB811, DB786, DB750, and DB766) with similar structural properties exhibited profound inhibition of tachyzoite proliferation. The lowest 50% inhibitory concentrations were found for DB786 (0.21 microM against Neospora and 0.22 microM against Toxoplasma) and DB750 (0.23 microM against Neospora and 0.16 microM against Toxoplasma), with complete proliferation inhibition at 1.7 microM for both drugs against both species. DB750 and DB786 were chosen for further studies. Electron microscopy of N. caninum-infected human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cultures revealed distinct alterations and damage of parasite ultrastructure upon drug treatment, while host cells remained unaffected. For true parasiticidal efficacy against N. caninum, a treatment duration of 3 h at 1.7 microM was sufficient for DB750, while a longer treatment period (24 h) was necessary for DB786. Pretreatment of tachyzoites for 1 h prior to host cell exposure had no effect on infectivity. However, pretreatment of uninfected host cells had a significant adverse effect on N. caninum proliferation: exposure of HFFs to 1.7 microM DB750 for 6, 12, or 24 h, followed by infection with N. caninum tachyzoites and subsequent culture in the absence of DB750, resulted in significantly delayed parasite proliferation. This suggests that either (i) these compounds or their respective active metabolites were still present after the removal of the drugs or (ii) the drug treatments reversibly impaired some functional activities in HFFs that were essential for parasite proliferation and/or survival.},

   abstract = {The carbonic anhydrase (CA) gene family has been reported to consist of at least 11 enzymatically active members and a few inactive homologous proteins. Recent analyses of human and mouse databases provided evidence that human and mouse genomes contain genes for still another novel CA isozyme hereby named CA XIII. In the present study, we modeled the structure of human CA XIII. This model revealed a globular molecule with high structural similarity to cytosolic isozymes, CA I, II, and III. Recombinant mouse CA XIII showed catalytic activity similar to those of mitochondrial CA V and cytosolic CA I, with k(cat)/K(m) of 4.3 x 10(7) m(-1) s(-1), and k(cat) of 8.3 x 10(4) s(-1). It is very susceptible to inhibition by sulfonamide and anionic inhibitors, with inhibition constants of 17 nm for acetazolamide, a clinically used sulfonamide, and of 0.25 microm, for cyanate, respectively. Using panels of cDNAs we evaluated human and mouse CA13 gene expression in a number of different tissues. In human tissues, positive signals were identified in the thymus, small intestine, spleen, prostate, ovary, colon, and testis. In mouse, positive tissues included the spleen, lung, kidney, heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. We also investigated the cellular and subcellular localization of CA XIII in human and mouse tissues using an antibody raised against a polypeptide of 14 amino acids common for both human and mouse orthologues. Immunohistochemical staining showed a unique and widespread distribution pattern for CA XIII compared with the other cytosolic CA isozymes. In conclusion, the predicted amino acid sequence, structural model, distribution, and activity data suggest that CA XIII represents a novel enzyme, which may play important physiological roles in several organs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accomplishment of the various genome sequencing projects resulted in accumulation of massive amount of gene sequence information. This calls for a large-scale computational method for predicting protein localization from sequence. The protein localization can provide valuable information about its molecular function, as well as the biological pathway in which it participates. The prediction of localization of a protein at subnuclear level is a challenging task. In our previous work we proposed an SVM-based system using protein sequence information for this prediction task. In this work, we assess protein similarity with Gene Ontology (GO) and then improve the performance of the system by adding a module of nearest neighbor classifier using a similarity measure derived from the GO annotation terms for protein sequences. RESULTS: The performance of the new system proposed here was compared with our previous system using a set of proteins resided within 6 localizations collected from the Nuclear Protein Database (NPD). The overall MCC (accuracy) is elevated from 0.284 (50.0%) to 0.519 (66.5%) for single-localization proteins in leave-one-out cross-validation; and from 0.420 (65.2%) to 0.541 (65.2%) for an independent set of multi-localization proteins. The new system is available at http://array.bioengr.uic.edu/subnuclear.htm. CONCLUSION: The prediction of protein subnuclear localizations can be largely influenced by various definitions of similarity for a pair of proteins based on different similarity measures of GO terms. Using the sum of similarity scores over the matched GO term pairs for two proteins as the similarity definition produced the best predictive outcome. Substantial improvement in predicting protein subnuclear localizations has been achieved by combining Gene Ontology with sequence information.},

Neither acetamidoacetone nor N,N-diacetylaminoacetone showed evidence of appreciable hydration in dilute aqueous solution, nor was any hydrate detectable in solutions of tosylglycine chloromethyl ketone. Substitution of acetaldehyde with acylamido substituents, as in several potent reversible inhibitors of papain, was found to enhance its equilibrium constant for covalent hydration by an order of magnitude; these inhibitors are about 90% hydrated in dilute aqueous solution, and their affinity for proteases may have been underestimated accordingly. The effects of deuterium substitution at C-1 of acetaldehyde, on equilibrium addition of oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles, are substantial and vary with the nature of the nucleophile. These isotope effects may be useful as a mean of distinguishing between alternative structures of complexes formed between enzymes and aldehydes.},

Inhibitory complexes might involve binding of the aldehyde intact or as a covalent hydrate, or the aldehyde might undergo covalent addition of an active site sulfhydryl group to form a thiohemiacetal derivative. In an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities, benzamidoacetaldehyde-1-d has been synthesized, and its properties compared with those of the undeuterated inhibitor. After correction for differences in hydration, the observed effect on inhibition is found to be compatible with formation of a thiohemiacetal. In keeping with this conclusion, benzamidoethanol (a partial analogue of the covalent hydrate) and benzamide, N-methylbenzamide and N-ethylbenzamide (somewhat similar to the free aldehyde in size and hydrophobic character) are found to exhibit negligible affinity for the active site.},

   abstract = {Orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP) decarboxylase appears to act upon its substrate without the intervention of metals or other cofactors and without the formation of covalent bonds between the enzyme and the substrate. Crystallographic information indicates that substrate binding forces the substrate's scissile carboxylate group into the neighborhood of several charged groups at the active site. It has been proposed that binding might result in electrostatic stress at the substrate's C6 carboxylate group in such a way as to promote decarboxylation by destabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex in its ground state. If that were the case, one would expect uridine 5'-phosphate (UMP) derivatives with bulky anionic substituents at C6 to be bound weakly compared with UMP, which is unsubstituted at C6. Here, we describe the formation of anionic 5,6-dihydro-6-sulfonyl derivatives by spontaneous addition of sulfite to UMP and to OMP. These sulfite addition reactions, which are slowly reversible and are not catalyzed by the enzyme, result in the appearance of one (or, in the case of OMP, two) bulky anionic substituents at the 6-carbon atom of UMP. These inhibitors are bound with affinities that surpass the binding affinity of UMP. We are led to infer that the active site of OMP decarboxylase is remarkably accommodating in the neighborhood of C6. These are not the properties that one would expect of an active site with a rigid structure that imposes sufficient electrostatic stress on the substrate to produce a major advancement along the reaction coordinate.},

Particularly remarkable are those enzymes that act as simple protein catalysts, without the assistance of metals or other cofactors. To determine the extent to which one such enzyme, human uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, enhances the rate of substrate decarboxylation, we examined the rate of spontaneous decarboxylation of pyrrolyl-3-acetate. Extrapolation of first-order rate constants measured at elevated temperatures indicates that this reaction proceeds with a half-life of 2.3 x 10(9) years at 25 degrees C in the absence of enzyme. This enzyme shows no significant homology with orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase), another cofactorless enzyme that catalyzes a very slow reaction. It is proposed that, in both cases, a protonated basic residue (Arg-37 in the case of human UroD; Lys-93 in the case of yeast ODCase) furnishes a counterion that helps the scissile carboxylate group of the substrate leave water and enter a relatively nonpolar environment, stabilizes the incipient carbanion generated by the departure of CO(2), and supplies the proton that takes its place.},

   abstract = {OMP decarboxylase (ODCase) generates a very large rate enhancement without the assistance of metals or other cofactors. The uncatalyzed decarboxylation of 1-methylorotate in water is shown to involve the monoanion, although uncharged 1-methylorotic acid is decarboxylated at a similar rate. To measure the extent to which the rate of the nonenzymatic decarboxylation of orotate derivatives might be enhanced by their removal from solvent water, the 1-phosphoribosyl moiety of OMP was replaced with 1-substituents that would allow it to enter less polar solvents. When the tetrabutylammonium salt of 1-cyclohexylorotate was transferred from water to a series of dipolar aprotic solvents, its rate of decarboxylation increased markedly, varying with the relative ability of each solvent to release the substrate in the ground state from stabilization by solvent water acting as a proton donor. These findings are consistent with the view that separation of the substrate from solvent water may contribute, at least to a limited extent, to the rate enhancement produced by ODCase. This enzyme's active site, like that of another cofactorless enzyme recently shown to produce a rate enhancement similar in magnitude (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase), is equipped with an ammonium group positioned in such a way as to balance the electrostatic charge of the carboxylate group of the substrate and later supply a proton to the incipient carbanion in a relatively waterless environment.},

   abstract = {During the initial event in protein self-splicing, a peptide bond to the nitrogen atom of an internal cysteine or serine residue is usually cleaved by the side chain -SH or -OH group to yield a thioester or oxyester intermediate that undergoes further reactions. Self-splicing reactions also accompany the maturation of hedgehog signaling proteins, plant-type asparaginases, and pyruvoyl enzymes. It would be of interest to know whether peptide bonds that involve the nitrogen atoms of cysteine or serine are more susceptible to cleavage than peptide bonds to amino acids that lack reactive side chains. Extrapolations of the results of model reactions conducted at elevated temperatures indicate that the -SH group of N-acetylcysteine enhances the rate of its hydrolysis by a factor of 70, while the OH group of N-acetylserine enhances the rate of its hydrolysis 12-fold, compared with the rate of hydrolysis of N-acetylalanine in neutral solution at 25 degrees C. Several lines of evidence suggest that the rate-enhancing effects of these -SH and -OH side chains arise from their ability to act as intramolecular general acid-base catalysts for hydrolysis, rather than as nucleophilic catalysts. The protein environment within self-splicing proteins appears to redirect the actions of these side chains to nucleophilic attack, generating rate enhancements that approach the rate enhancements generated by conventional enzymes.},

   abstract = {To establish the rates and mechanisms of decomposition of guanidine and amidine derivatives in aqueous solution and the rate enhancements produced by the corresponding enzymes, we examined their rates of reaction at elevated temperatures and used the Arrhenius equation to extrapolate the results to room temperature. The similar reactivities of methylguanidine and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine and their negative entropies of activation imply that their decomposition proceeds by hydrolysis rather than elimination. The influence of changing pH on the rate of decomposition is consistent with attack by hydroxide ion on the methylguanidinium ion (k2 = 5 x 10(-6) M(-1) s(-1) at 25 degrees C) or with the kinetically equivalent attack by water on uncharged methylguanidine. At 25 degrees C and pH 7, N-methylguanidine is several orders of magnitude more stable than acetamidine, urea, or acetamide. Under the same conditions, the enzymes arginase and agmatinase accelerate substrate hydrolysis 4 x 10(14)-fold and 6 x 10(12)-fold, respectively, by mechanisms that appear to involve metal-mediated water attack. Arginine deiminase accelerates substrate hydrolysis 6 x 10(12)-fold by a mechanism that (in contrast to the mechanisms employed by arginase and agmatinase) is believed to involve attack by an active-site cysteine residue.},

   abstract = {Malaria is a fatal tropical and subtropical disease caused by the protozoal species Plasmodium. Many commonly available antimalarial drugs and therapies are becoming ineffective because of the emergence of multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum, which drives the need for the development of new antimalarial drugs. Recently, a series of 3-carboxyl-4(1H)-quinolone analogs, derived from the famous compound endochin, were reported as promising candidates for orally efficacious antimalarials. In this study, to analyze the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of these quinolones and investigate the structural requirements for antimalarial activity, the 2D multiple linear regressions (MLR) method and 3D comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) methods are employed to evolve different QSAR models. All these models give satisfactory results with highly accurate fitting and strong external predictive abilities for chemicals not used in model development. Furthermore, the contour maps from 3D models can provide an intuitive understanding of the key structure features responsible for the antimalarial activities. In conclusion, we summarize the detailed position-specific structural requirements of these derivatives accordingly. All these results are helpful for the rational design of new compounds with higher antimalarial bioactivities.},

The underlying relational database infrastructure, Genomics Unified Schema (GUS), enables complex biologically based queries, facilitating validation of gene models, identification of alternative splicing, detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms, identification of stage-specific genes and recognition of phylogenetically conserved and phylogenetically restricted sequences.},

Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a DNA/RNA sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as BLAST.},

Orthogonal encoding, employing 20 numbers to describe the amino acid type of one protein residue, is often used with artificial neural network (ANN) models. However, this can increase the model complexity, thus leading to difficulty in implementation and poor performance. Here, we use ANNs to derive encoding schemes for the amino acid types from protein three-dimensional structure alignments. Each of the 20 amino acid types is characterized with a few real numbers. Our schemes are tested on the simulation of amino acid substitution matrices. These simplified schemes outperform the orthogonal encoding on small data sets. Using one of these encoding schemes, we generate a colouring scheme for the amino acids in which comparable amino acids are in similar colours. We expect it to be useful for visual inspection and manual editing of protein multiple sequence alignments.},

   abstract = {Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is encoded by the gene that when mutated causes the primary immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid) in mice. Btk is a member of the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and plays a vital, but diverse, modulatory role in many cellular processes. Mutations affecting Btk block B-lymphocyte development. Btk is conserved among species, and in this review, we present the sequence of the full-length rat Btk and find it to be analogous to the mouse Btk sequence. We have also analyzed the wealth of information compiled in the mutation database for XLA (BTKbase), representing 554 unique molecular events in 823 families and demonstrate that only selected amino acids are sensitive to replacement (P < 0.001). Although genotype-phenotype correlations have not been established in XLA, based on these findings, we hypothesize that this relationship indeed exists. Using short interfering-RNA technology, we have previously generated active constructs downregulating Btk expression. However, application of recently established guidelines to enhance or decrease the activity was not successful, demonstrating the importance of the primary sequence. We also review the outcome of expression profiling, comparing B lymphocytes from XLA-, Xid-, and Btk-knockout (KO) donors to healthy controls. Finally, in spite of a few genes differing in expression between Xid- and Btk-KO mice, in vivo competition between cells expressing either mutation shows that there is no selective survival advantage of cells carrying one genetic defect over the other. We conclusively demonstrate that for the R28C-missense mutant (Xid), there is no biologically relevant residual activity or any dominant negative effect versus other proteins.},

   abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum and vivax are responsible for the majority of malaria infections worldwide, resulting in over a million deaths annually. Malaria parasites now show measured resistance to all currently utilized drugs. Novel antimalarial drugs are urgently needed. The Plasmodium Kinesin-5 mechanoenzyme is a suitable "next generation" target. Discovered via small molecule screen experiments, the human Kinesin-5 has multiple allosteric sites that are "druggable." One site in particular, unique in its sequence divergence across all homologs in the superfamily and even within the same family, exhibits exquisite drug specificity. We propose that Plasmodium Kinesin-5 shares this allosteric site and likewise can be targeted to uncover inhibitors with high specificity. To test this idea, we performed a screen for inhibitors selective for Plasmodium Kinesin-5 ATPase activity in parallel with human Kinesin-5. Our screen of nearly 2000 compounds successfully identified compounds that selectively inhibit both P. vivax and falciparum Kinesin-5 motor domains but, as anticipated, do not impact human Kinesin-5 activity. Of note is a candidate drug that did not biochemically compete with the ATP substrate for the conserved active site or disrupt the microtubule-binding site. Together, our experiments identified MMV666693 as a selective allosteric inhibitor of Plasmodium Kinesin-5; this is the first identified protein target for the Medicines of Malaria Venture validated collection of parasite proliferation inhibitors. This work demonstrates that chemical screens against human kinesins are adaptable to homologs in disease organisms and, as such, extendable to strategies to combat infectious disease.},

   abstract = {Artemisinin drugs have become the first-line antimalarials in areas of multi-drug resistance. However, monotherapy with artemisinin drugs results in comparatively high recrudescence rates. Autoinduction of CYP-mediated metabolism, resulting in reduced exposure, has been supposed to be the underlying mechanism. To better understand the autoinduction of artemisinin drugs, we evaluated the biotransformation of artemisinin, also known as Qing-hao-su (QHS), and its active derivative dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in vitro and in vivo, using LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer in conjunction with online hydrogen (H)/deuterium (D) exchange high-resolution (HR)-LC/MS (mass spectrometry) for rapid structural characterization. The LC separation was improved allowing the separation of QHS parent drugs and their metabolites from their diastereomers. Thirteen phase I metabolites of QHS have been identified in liver microsomal incubates, rat urine, bile and plasma, including six deoxyhydroxylated metabolites, five hydroxylated metabolites, one dihydroxylated metabolite and deoxyartemisinin. Twelve phase II metabolites of QHS were detected in rat bile, urine and plasma. DHA underwent similar metabolic pathways, and 13 phase I metabolites and 3 phase II metabolites were detected. Accurate mass data were obtained in both full-scan and MS/MS mode to support assignments of metabolite structures. Online H/D exchange LC-HR/MS experiments provided additional evidence in differentiating deoxydihydroxylated metabolites from mono-hydroxylated metabolites. The results showed that the main phase I metabolites of artemisinin drugs are hydroxylated and deoxyl products, and they will undergo subsequent phase II glucuronidation processes. This study also demonstrated the effectiveness of online H/D exchange LC-HR/MS(n) technique in rapid identification of drug metabolites.},

   abstract = {Many studies have shown that primary prostate cancers are multifocal and are composed of multiple genetically distinct cancer cell clones. Whether or not multiclonal primary prostate cancers typically give rise to multiclonal or monoclonal prostate cancer metastases is largely unknown, although studies at single chromosomal loci are consistent with the latter case. Here we show through a high-resolution genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism and copy number survey that most, if not all, metastatic prostate cancers have monoclonal origins and maintain a unique signature copy number pattern of the parent cancer cell while also accumulating a variable number of separate subclonally sustained changes. We find no relationship between anatomic site of metastasis and genomic copy number change pattern. Taken together with past animal and cytogenetic studies of metastasis and recent single-locus genetic data in prostate and other metastatic cancers, these data indicate that despite common genomic heterogeneity in primary cancers, most metastatic cancers arise from a single precursor cancer cell. This study establishes that genomic archeology of multiple anatomically separate metastatic cancers in individuals can be used to define the salient genomic features of a parent cancer clone of proven lethal metastatic phenotype.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites have complex life cycles, frequently split between different hosts and reliant on rapid responses as the parasites react to changing environmental conditions. Calcium ion (Ca(2+)) signaling is consequently essential for the cellular and developmental changes that support Apicomplexan parasitism. Apicomplexan genomes reveal a rich repertoire of genes involved in calcium signaling, although many of the genes responsible for observed physiological changes remain unknown. There is evidence, for example, for the presence of a nifedipine-sensitive calcium entry mechanism in Toxoplasma, but the molecular components involved in Ca(2+) entry in both Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, have not been identified. The major calcium stores are the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the acidocalcisomes, and the plant-like vacuole in Toxoplasma, or the food vacuole in Plasmodium spp. Pharmacological evidence suggests that Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores may be mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR) although there is no molecular evidence for the presence of receptors for these second messengers in the parasites. Several Ca(2+)-ATPases are present in Apicomplexans and a putative mitochondrial Ca(2+)/H(+) exchanger has been identified. Apicomplexan genomes contain numerous genes encoding Ca(2+)-binding proteins, with the notable expansion of calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), whose study has revealed roles in gliding motility, microneme secretion, host cell invasion and egress, and parasite differentiation. Microneme secretion has also been shown to depend on the C2 domain containing protein DOC2 in both Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma, providing further evidence for the complex transduction of Ca(2+) signals in these organisms. The characterization of these pathways could lead to the discovery of novel drug targets and to a better understanding of the role of Ca(2+) in these parasites.},

   abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum pathogenesis is affected by various cell types in the blood, including platelets, which can kill intraerythrocytic malaria parasites. Platelets could mediate these antimalarial effects through human defense peptides (HDPs), which exert antimicrobial effects by permeabilizing membranes. Therefore, we screened a panel of HDPs and determined that human platelet factor 4 (hPF4) kills malaria parasites inside erythrocytes by selectively lysing the parasite digestive vacuole (DV). PF4 rapidly accumulates only within infected erythrocytes and is required for parasite killing in infected erythrocyte-platelet cocultures. To exploit this antimalarial mechanism, we tested a library of small, nonpeptidic mimics of HDPs (smHDPs) and identified compounds that kill P. falciparum by rapidly lysing the parasite DV while sparing the erythrocyte plasma membrane. Lead smHDPs also reduced parasitemia in a murine malaria model. Thus, identifying host molecules that control parasite growth can further the development of related molecules with therapeutic potential.},

Implementation of mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics approaches has informed on key phospho-signalling pathways in the parasite. In addition, global phenotypic screens have revealed a large number of putative protein kinase inhibitors with antimalarial potency.

Nucleoside analogues where the leaving NH(3) group is replaced by a proton and prevent conversion of the transition state to product are very potent inhibitors of the enzyme. However, stable carbocyclic versions of these analogues are less effective as the role of the ribose in facilitating formation of hydrated species is abolished. The discovery that a 1,3-diazepinone riboside (4) operated as a tight-binding inhibitor of CDA independent of hydration provided the opportunity to study novel inhibitors built as conformationally locked, carbocyclic 1,3-diazepinone nucleosides to determine the enzyme's conformational preference for a specific form of sugar pucker. This work describes the synthesis of two target bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane nucleosides, locked as north (5) and south (6) conformers, as well as a flexible analogue (7) built with a cyclopentane ring. The seven-membered 1,3-diazepinone ring in all the three targets was built from the corresponding benzoyl-protected carbocyclic bis-allyl ureas by ring-closing metathesis. The results demonstrate CDA's binding preference for a south sugar pucker in agreement with the high-resolution crystal structures of other CDA inhibitors bound at the active site.},

We have begun to understand how Plasmodium liver stage parasites protect their host hepatocytes from apoptosis during parasite development and how they induce an ordered cell death at the end of the liver stage. Toxoplasma parasites are also known to regulate host cell survival pathways and it has been convincingly demonstrated that they block host cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent antigen presentation of parasite epitopes to avoid cell-mediated immune responses. Theileria parasites are the masters of host cell modulation because their presence immortalises the infected cell. It is now accepted that multiple pathways are activated to induce Theileria-dependent host cell transformation. Although it is now known that similar host cell pathways are affected by the different parasites, the outcome for the infected cell varies considerably. Improved imaging techniques and new methods to control expression of parasite and host cell proteins will help us to analyse the molecular details of parasite-dependent host cell modifications.},

However, it is still difficult for researchers to choose the best method due to the lack of an effective comparison. For the first time we have made an extensive study on methods for feature extraction, feature transformation and multiclassifier systems (MCS) in the problem of HIV-1 protease. In this work we report an experimental comparison on several learning systems coupled with different feature representations. We confirm previous results stating that linear classifiers obtain higher performance than non-linear classifiers using orthonormal encoding, but we also show that using Karhunen-Loeve transform the performance of neural networks are comparable to one of linear support vector machines. Finally we propose a new hierarchical approach that, for the first time, combines ideas derived from the machine learning methodologies and from a knowledge base of this particular problem. This approach proves to be a successful attempt to obtain a drastically error reduction with respect to the performance of linear classifiers: the error rate decreases from 9.1% using linear-SVM to 6.6% using our new hierarchical classifier based on some pattern rules.},

We summarize the most important insights in alternative splicing including its role in regulating gene expression by decreasing mRNA abundance via 'Regulated Unproductive Splicing and Translation'. As a related but less well-understood mechanism, we discuss also our recent work suggesting a role for intron retention for precluding translation of stage specific isoforms of T. gondii glycolytic enzymes. We additionally provide new evidence that intron retention might be a widespread mechanism during parasite differentiation. Supporting this notion, recent genome-wide analysis of Toxoplasma and Plasmodium suggests intron retention is more pervasive than heretofore thought. These findings parallel recent emergence of intron retention being more prevalent in mammals than previously believed, thereby adding to the established roles in plants, fungi and unicellular eukaryotes. Deeper mechanistic studies of intron retention will provide important insight into its role in regulating gene expression in apicomplexan parasites and more general in eukaryotic organisms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinically-diagnosed malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Uganda accounting for 25 to 40% of outpatients, 15 to 20% of all hospital admissions, and 9 to 14% of all hospital deaths. This situation was exacerbated by The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebellion in northern Uganda which completely ran down the health care system. While malaria remains the number one killer disease in northern Uganda, antimalarials are lacking in the public health facilities. Consequently, Private-for-profit drug-outlets have come up to help bridge the gap. However, the cost-effectiveness and treatment outcome ratings of antimalarials are not clear. Objective: To assess the pharmacoeconomics of malaria treatment in Private-for-profit (PFP) drug-outlets in Gulu Municipality and Kitgum Town Council. METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study sites were registered drug outlets. Study participants were drug-outlet owners, their employees, and malaria patients. We employed both purposive and random sampling methods to select the study participants. Data were collected using questionnaires and analysed using the SPSS computer package. RESULTS: Up to 91.1% of the respondents indicated that antimalarials are expensive. The prices varied from less than 5,000 to over 20,000 Ugandan shillings per dose (Exchange rate: 1$ = Ush 2,650). Fansidar and chloroquine were rated as being relatively cheap and ACTs expensive (Ush 11,000 to 15,000). Duration of treatment, frequency of administration, needles and syringes, raised the cost of some medicines. Most patients preferred cheap medicines (76.2%); those with low administration frequencies (77.5%); and those with short treatment duration (95%). Most patients (80.9%) buy antimalarials without testing, while 66.6% do not buy full doses. CONCLUSION: The cost benefit analysis of the use of antimalarials is unfavourable. The unit price of the medicines, their irrational use and the lack of professionals in the outlets together add up to high overall costs and poor treatment outcomes.},

   abstract = {Based on a variety of genetic, biochemical, and neuropathological evidence, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been suggested to be causal in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta has been shown to mediate neurodegenerative and inflammatory changes associated with amyloid plaques, as well as exert direct neurotoxicity through oligomeric forms of Abeta. The mechanism of Abeta toxicity, however, remains largely unknown. In this work, we show that an early event after exposure of postmitotic neurons to Abeta is tyrosine phosphorylation of FISH adapter protein. FISH binds to and potentially regulates certain ADAM family members. We present evidence that FISH and ADAM12 mediate the neurotoxic effect of Abeta. Expression of an ADAM12 protease-deficient mutant (ADAM12DeltaMP) blocks Abeta-induced neuronal death, and expression of an N-terminal fragment of FISH reduces Abeta toxicity. The C-terminal fragment of FISH containing the ADAMs binding region is found to be sufficient for induction of neuronal death, which is prevented by coexpression of the ADAM12DeltaMP. Abeta treatment, as well as expression of the C-terminal toxic FISH fragment, induces accumulation of ADAM12 N-terminal cleavage product in conditioned medium, demonstrating activation of the ADAM metalloprotease/sheddase activity. ADAM12 protein is reduced in AD brains, pointing to a possible increase in ADAM12 proteolytic activity. These data suggest that Abeta toxicity is mediated by FISH and ADAM12 and may provide insights into therapeutic strategies for AD treatment.},

Mutations of the surrounding residues have been shown to cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Substitutions R562P and A582V were noticed to have impaired kinase activity. However, based on Western blot analysis, the mutant proteins were expressed at normal levels. Molecular modeling of the kinase domain has previously indicated that these residues presumably govern the position of the W563 side chain, which is thought to interact with the catalytic loop. W563 is inside the molecule and too far away from the catalytic center to interact directly with the substrate or cofactors. To prove these model-based conclusions, a conservative substitution with phenylalanine for W563 was made, and the resultant mutant lacked kinase activity. These results confirm our previous assumption that the side chain of W563, invariant in protein tyrosine kinases, is crucial for Btk kinase activity. Mutations in the surrounding residues seem to inactivate Btk by affecting the location of W563.},

   abstract = {Introduction. The aim of this study was to identify the antimalarials prescribed during the pregnancy and to document their timing. Method. From June to September 2009, a survey was conducted on 565 women who gave birth in the Castors maternity in Bangui. The antenatal clinics cards were checked in order to record the types of antimalarials prescribed during pregnancy according to gestational age. Results. A proportion of 28.8% ANC cards contained at least one antimalarial prescription. The commonest categories of antimalarials prescribed were: quinine (56.7%), artemisinin-based combinations (26.8%) and artemisinin monotherapy (14.4%). Among the prescriptions that occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy, artemisinin-based combinations and artemisinin monotherapies represented the proportions of (10.9%) and (13.3%). respectively. Conclusion. This study showed a relatively high rate (>80%) of the recommended antimalarials prescription regarding categories of indicated antimalarials from national guidelines. But, there is a concern about the prescription of the artemisinin derivatives in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the prescription of artemisinin monotherapy. Thus, the reinforcement of awareness activities of health care providers on the national malaria treatment during pregnancy is suggested.},

We now report a novel short TRbeta1 RNA splice variant in humans lacking 35 nucleotides at the 3' end of the non-coding exon 1 due to an alternative 5' splice donor site. This short variant was first identified in sequences of cDNA obtained from cultured human fibroblasts. Both variants were found in human fibroblasts, brain, pituitary, adrenal gland, placenta, muscle, thyroid and lymphocytes. These TRbeta1 variants possess splice donor sites with a sequence score slightly favoring the TRbeta1 long variant. Variant-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that their relative proportions were equal except in pituitary and muscle, in which the long form was 3- and 5-fold in excess. T3 treatment of fibroblasts grown in thyroid hormone depleted medium did not affect the absolute or relative expression of the two variants. Furthermore, the expression level in fibroblasts from patients with resistance to thyroid hormone with or without TRbeta gene mutations was not different to that in fibroblasts from normal controls.},

   abstract = {HIV-1 Nef has previously been shown to bind to Src homology-3 (SH3) domains of a subset of Src family tyrosine kinases. In addition, Nef has been reported to coprecipitate with a serine/threonine kinase activity termed NAK (for Nef-associated kinase). The identity of NAK remains uncertain, but it has been suggested to represent a novel member of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family. We report here that NAK autophosphorylation is increased not only by an activated form of the p21-family GTPase cdc42 but also by a plasma membrane-targeted fragment of the adapter protein Nck, thus providing further evidence that NAK is related to PAKs. A detailed structure-based mutational analysis of Nef revealed that all amino acid changes that inhibited the Nef/Hck-SH3 interaction, as measured by surface-plasmon resonance, also abolished coprecipitation of NAK. As PAK family proteins do not contain SH3 domains, these observations are best explained by a protein complex in which Nef, NAK, and an SH3-protein all contact each other. In addition, a number of conserved amino acids in Nef that are not involved in SH3 binding were also found to be crucial for association with NAK. Molecular modeling suggests that these residues are involved in formation of an adjacent binding surface for NAK or another critical component of the NAK/Nef complex.},

   abstract = {Rhoptry-associated protein 2 (RAP2) is known to be discharged from rhoptry onto the membrane surface of infected and uninfected erythrocytes (UEs) ex vivo and in vitro and this information provides new insights into the understanding of the pathology of severe anemia in falciparum malaria. In this study, a hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein corresponding to residues 5-190 of the N-terminal of Plasmodium falciparum RAP2 (rN-RAP2) was produced using a new method of solubilization and purification. Expression was induced with D-lactose, a less expensive alternative inducer to the more common isopropyl-beta-D-thio-galactopyranosidase. The recombinant protein was purified using two types of commercially-available affinity columns, iminodiacetic and nitrilotriacetic. rN-RAP2 had immunogenic potential, since it induced high titers of anti-RAP2 antibodies in mice. These antibodies recognized full-length RAP2 prepared from Triton X-100 extracts from two strains of P. falciparum. In fact, the antibody recognized a 29-kDa product of RAP2 cleavage as well as 82 and 70-kDa products of RAP1 cleavage. These results indicate that the two antigens share sequence epitopes. Our expressed protein fragment was shown to contain a functional epitope that is also present in rhoptry-derived ring surface protein 2 which attaches to the surface of both infected and UEs and erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow of malaria patients. Serum from malaria patients who developed anemia during infection recognized rN-RAP2, suggesting that this protein fragment may be important for epidemiological studies investigating whether immune responses to RAP2 exacerbate hemolysis in falciparum malaria patients.},

   abstract = {PRINCIPLES: Amyloids are highly cross-beta-sheet-rich aggregated states that confer protease resistance, membrane activity and multivalence properties to proteins, all essential features for the undesired preservation of food proteins transiting the gastrointestinal tract and causing type I allergy. METHODS: Amyloid propensity of beta-parvalbumin, the major fish allergen, was theoretically analysed and assayed under gastrointestinal-relevant conditions using the binding of thioflavin T, the formation of sodium dodecyl sulphate- (SDS-) resistant aggregates, circular dichroism spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy fibril imaging. Impact of amyloid aggregates on allergenicity was assessed with dot blot. RESULTS: Sequences of beta-parvalbumin from species with commercial value contain several adhesive hexapeptides capable of driving amyloid formation. Using Atlantic cod beta-parvalbumin (rGad m 1) displaying high IgE cross-reactivity, we found that formation of amyloid fibres under simulated gastrointestinal conditions accounts for the resistance to acid and neutral proteases, for the presence of membrane active species under gastrointestinal relevant conditions and for the IgE-recognition in the sera of allergic patients. Incorporation of the anti-amyloid compound epigallocatechin gallate prevents rGad m 1 fibrillation, facilitates its protease digestion and impairs its recognition by IgE. CONCLUSIONS: the formation of amyloid by rGad m 1 explains its degradation resistance, its facilitated passage across the intestinal epithelial barrier and its epitope architecture as allergen.},

It is shown that the biolistic delivery of mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) materials can be improved by increasing the density of MSNs through gold plating. Additionally, a DNA-coating protocol is used based on calcium chloride and spermidine for MSN and gold nanorods to enhance the NP-mediated DNA delivery. Furthermore, the drastic improvement of NP delivery is demonstrated when the particles are combined with 0.6 mum gold particles during bombardment. The methodology described provides a system for the efficient delivery of NPs into plant cells using the biolistic method.},

Thereafter, signal sequences are cleaved from the pre-protein and liberated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We have recently reported that some liberated signal peptides are further processed by the intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease signal peptide peptidase. Cleavage in the membrane-spanning portion of the signal peptide promotes the release of signal peptide fragments from the lipid bilayer. Typical processes that include intramembrane proteolysis is the regulatory or signalling function of cleavage products. Likewise, signal peptide fragments liberated upon intramembrane cleavage may promote such post-targeting functions in the cell.},

   abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that presenilins (PSs) and signal peptide peptidase (SPP) are members of a novel protease family of integral membrane proteins that may utilize a catalytic mechanism similar to classic aspartic proteases such as pepsin, renin and cathepsin D. The defining features of the PSs and SPP are their ability to cleave substrate polypeptides within a transmembrane region, the presence of two active site aspartate residues in adjacent membrane-spanning regions and a conserved PAL motif near their COOH-terminus. PSs appear to be the catalytic subunit of multiprotein complexes that possess gamma-secretase activity. Because this activity generates the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) deposited in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), PSs are considered therapeutic targets in AD. In contrast to PSs that are not active unless part of a larger complex, SPP does not appear to require protein co-factors. Because of its requirement for hepatitis C virus maturation and a possible immune modulatory role, SPP is also considered a potential therapeutic target. Four additional PS/SPP homologs have been identified in humans; yet, their functions have not been elucidated. Herein, we will review the recent advances in our understanding of the PS/SPP family of proteases as well as discuss aspects of intramembrane cleavage that are not well understood.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several predisposition loci for hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) have been suggested, including HPCX1 at Xq27-q28, but due to the complex structure of the region, the susceptibility gene has not yet been identified. METHODS: In this study, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) inhibition was used for the discovery of truncating mutations. Six prostate cancer (PC) patients and their healthy brothers were selected from a group of HPCX1-linked families. Expression analyses were done using Agilent 44 K oligoarrays, and selected genes were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. In addition, microRNA expression levels in the lymphoblastic cells were analyzed to trace variants that might alter miRNA expression and explain partly an inherited genetic predisposion to PC. RESULTS: Seventeen genes were selected for resequencing based on the NMD array, but no truncating mutations were found. The most interesting variant was MAGEC1 p.Met1?. An association was seen between the variant and unselected PC (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.10-5.02) and HPC (OR = 3.38, 95% CI = 1.10-10.40). miRNA analysis revealed altogether 29 miRNAs with altered expression between the PC cases and controls. miRNA target analysis revealed that 12 of them also had possible target sites in the MAGEC1 gene. These miRNAs were selected for validation process including four miRNAs located in the X chromosome. The expressions of 14 miRNAs were validated in families that contributed to the significant signal differences in Agilent arrays. CONCLUSIONS: Further functional studies are needed to fully understand the possible contribution of these miRNAs and MAGEC1 start codon variant to PC.},

   abstract = {Src homology 2 (SH2) domains recognize phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing sequences and thereby mediate their association to ligands. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase, in which mutations cause a hereditary immunodeficiency disease, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Mutations have been found in all Btk domains, including SH2. We have analyzed the structural and functional effects of six disease-related amino acid substitutions in the SH2 domain: G302E, R307G, Y334S, L358F, Y361C, and H362Q. Also, we present a novel Btk SH2 missense mutation, H362R, leading to classical XLA. Based on circular dichroism analysis, the conformation of five of the XLA mutants studied differs from the native Btk SH2 domain, while mutant R307G is structurally identical. The binding of XLA mutation-containing SH2 domains to pY-Sepharose was reduced, varying between 1 and 13% of that for the native SH2 domain. The solubility of all the mutated proteins was remarkably reduced. SH2 domain mutations were divided into three categories: 1) Functional mutations, which affect residues presumably participating directly in pY binding (R307G); 2) structural mutations that, via conformational change, not only impair pY binding, but severely derange the structure of the SH2 domain and possibly interfere with the overall conformation of the Btk molecule (G302E, Y334S, L358F, and H362Q); and 3) structural-functional mutations, which contain features from both categories above (Y361C).},

The affected gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase, Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase, designated Btk. Btk and the other family members, Tec, ltk and Bmx, contain five regions, four of which are common structural and functional modules that are found in other signaling proteins. Mutations affect all domains of the gene, but amino acid substitutions seem to be confined to certain regions. More than 150 unique mutations have been identified and are collected in a mutation database, BTKbase. Here we discuss the three-dimensional structural implications of such mutations and their putative functional role. Of special interest are mutations affecting the pleckstrin homology domain, as Btk is the only disease-associated protein so far reported to carry mutations in this particular module.},

Recent research has uncovered some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying parasite motility, transmigration, and cell invasion during life cycle progression. The gliding motor machinery is embedded between the plasma membrane and the inner membrane complex, a unique double membrane layer. It consists ofimmobilized unconventional myosins, short actin stubs, and TRAP-family invasins. Assembly of this motor machinery enables force generation between parasite cytoskeletal components and an extracellular substratum. Unique properties of the individual components suggest that the rational design of motility inhibitors may lead to new intervention strategies to combat some of the most devastating human and livestock diseases.},

   abstract = {The artemisinins are the most effective antimalarial drugs known. They possess a remarkably wide therapeutic index. These agents have been used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for more than 2,000 years but were not subjected to scientific scrutiny until the 1970s. The first formal clinical trials of the artemisinins, and the development of methods for their industrial scale production, followed rapidly. A decade later, Chinese scientists shared their findings with the rest of the world; since then, a significant body of international trial evidence has confirmed these drugs to be far superior to any available alternatives. In particular, they have the ability to rapidly kill a broad range of asexual parasite stages at safe concentrations that are consistently achievable via standard dosing regimens. As their half-life is very short, there was also thought to be a low risk of resistance. These discoveries coincided with the appearance and spread of resistance to all the other major classes of antimalarials. As a result, the artemisinins now form an essential element of recommended first-line antimalarial treatment regimens worldwide. To minimize the risk of artemisinin resistance, they are recommended to be used to treat uncomplicated malaria in combination with other antimalarials as artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). Their rollout has resulted in documented reductions in malaria prevalence in a number of African and Asian countries. Unfortunately, there are already worrisome early signs of artemisinin resistance appearing in western Cambodia. If this resistance were to spread, it would be disastrous for malaria control efforts worldwide. The enormous challenge for the international community is how to avert this catastrophe and preserve the effectiveness of this antimalarial "magic bullet". Drug Dev Res 71: 12-19, 2010.

However, improper home management may be the cause of delay in seeking professional health care. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient department of Buzuruga Health Centre in Mwanza, Tanzania and involved 372 children < 5 years of age. Socio-demographic data of caregivers and children, type and source of treatment, and duration of fever were recorded. A total of 283 (76.1%) febrile underfives had received different types of treatment at home, before presenting at the hospital. The majority received antipyretics (204; 72.1%), and only a few (31; 10.9%) received antimalarials. The major sources of drugs were local drug stores (270; 94.7%). Duration of fever > 1 day (OR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.95-3.70; P < 0.001), low grade fever (OR = 4.37, 95% CI: 2.60-7.35; P < 0.001) and fever accompanied with other major complaints (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.23; P = 0.002) were significantly associated with prompt home medication before presenting to the health centre. In logistic regression analysis, duration of fever, low-grade fever and the presence of other symptoms remained significant predictors to receive antimalarial and or antipyretic drugs. In conclusion, home treatments with antipyretics and antimalarials in preschool children are common in Mwanza. Management of fevers may be improved by educating caregivers on community standard case definition of malaria while emphasizing the importance of early seeking of health facility services.},

   abstract = {The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has two extrachromosomal DNAs associated with organelles whose function is unclear. Both genomes encode ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) that are distinct from the nuclear-encoded rRNAs. Secondary structure analysis of all the P. falciparum rRNAs indicates that only the large subunit (LSU) rRNA encoded by the plastid-like genome is the target for thiostrepton. Indeed we find that thiostrepton inhibits growth of the parasite in the micromolar range which is 10-fold below concentrations with observable effects on total protein synthesis. We have further examined selective effects of thiostrepton on the plastid function by comparing differential effects of the drug on cytoplasmic and organellar encoded transcripts. Treatment with either thiostrepton or rifampin, an inhibitor of organellar and eubacterial RNA polymerase, both showed disappearance of organellar-encoded RNA transcripts within 6 h of treatment while transcripts of a nuclear-encoded mRNA remained constant for at least 8 h of treatment. Hence, we show a selective effect on organelle function that is suggestive of interference in the protein synthesis apparatus of the plastid. Sensitivity of P. falciparum to thiostrepton confirms that the plastid-like genome is essential for the erythrocytic cycle and presents a novel therapeutic site for this class of antibiotics.},

From this enhanced set, we identified the carbamoyl triazole TCMDC-134379 (1), a known serine protease inhibitor, as an excellent starting point for SAR profiling. Lead optimization of 1 led to several molecules with improved antimalarial potency, metabolic stabilities in mouse and human liver microsomes, along with acceptable cytotoxicity profiles. Analogue 44 displayed potent in vitro activity (IC50 = 10 nM) and oral activity in a SCID mouse model of Pf infection with an ED50 of 100 and ED90 of between 100 and 150 mg kg(-1), respectively. The results presented encourage further investigations to identify the target of these highly active compounds.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) is a condition caused by tissue hyposensitivity to the effects of circulating thyroid hormone, and may be misdiagnosed as hyperthyroidism. AIMS: We report the first case of RTH in an Irish patient highlighting the clinical features and the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the characteristic laboratory abnormalities found in the condition. METHODS: We describe an isolated case of RTH initially misdiagnosed as hyperthyroidism, and detail the investigations which ultimately led to the correct diagnosis. Genetic screening of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene was performed. RESULTS: Thyroid function tests including T3 suppression test and TRH-stimulation test suggested a diagnosis of RTH. Genetic testing failed to demonstrate a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor. CONCLUSION: RTH is a rare inherited condition that may be misdiagnosed as hyperthyroidism. The case we describe most likely results from a de novo mutation in an as yet undiscovered gene. RTH should be considered in patients with elevated thyroid hormone levels and normal TSH so that unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment can be avoided.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are at increased risk from malaria. Resistance to all classes of antimalarials has affected the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To review the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarials used for treatment and intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library between January 1998 and December 2009 for publications using the medical subject headings: efficacy, antimalarials, malaria, pregnancy, pharmacokinetics, treatment, IPT and placenta positive. In May 2010 we searched the register of clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) and of WHO (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/) using 'malaria', and 'pregnancy' and 'treatment'. SELECTION CRITERIA: We identified 233 abstracts, reviewed 83 full text articles and included 60 studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors entered extracted data to an excel spreadsheet. MAIN RESULTS: Parasitological failure rates, placenta positivity rates (assessed by microscopy) or both were reported in 44% (21/48), 46% (22/48) and 10% (5/48) of articles, respectively. Most pharmacokinetic studies (9/12) suggested dose optimisation. In 23 treatment studies 17 different antimalarial drugs were delivered in 53 study arms; 43.4% (23/53) reported a failure rate of < 5%; 83.3% of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) arms and 9% of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) arms had failure rates >/= 10%. Placenta-positive rates (mostly reported in the context of IPT in pregnancy) were > 10% in 68% (23/34) of SP trial arms and > 15% in all seven chloroquine arms. The ACT provided lower parasitological failure and gametocyte carriage rates. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: Drugs used in pregnancy should aim for 95% efficacy but many currently deployed regimens are associated with much lower cure rates.},

Thus, recent high-throughput screening campaigns have been initiated using asexual intraerythrocytic stage cell-based assays of Plasmodium falciparum. These have led to the unprecedented identification of over 10,000 new antimalarial compounds. Inherently, novel compounds identified by cell-based assays will have poorly defined modes of action. While some of these compounds may have recognizable targets, the majority of cell-based hits are comprised of unique chemical scaffolds usually lacking cross-resistance with known drugs. It is likely that these novel antimalarial scaffolds will reveal new targets. A challenge for the community will be to assign these small molecules to their targets. In this article, we review methodologies to assist in the determination of a compound's mode of action.},

In contrast to most intracellular pathogens these protozoans are believed to invade a rather passive host cell in a process, that is, tightly linked to the ability of the parasites to move by gliding motility. Indeed specific inhibitors against components of the gliding machinery and the analysis of knockdown mutants demonstrate a linkage of gliding motility and invasion. Intriguingly, new data show that it is possible to block gliding motility, while host cell invasion still occurs. This suggests that either the current models established for host cell invasion need to be critically revised or that alternative, motor independent mechanisms are in place including a more active role of the host cell that can complement a missing actin-myosin-system. Here we discuss some of the discrepancies that need to be addressed for a better understanding of invasion.},

The chemical nature of this activation and the ultimate toxic species remain controversial and this review will focus upon studies published on this topic over the past year.

They are selectively cytotoxic to mammalian cancer cell lines and have been implicated as neurotoxic and embryotoxic in animal studies. The endoperoxide functional group is both the pharmacophore and toxicophore, but the proposed chemical mechanisms and targets of cytotoxicity remain unclear. In this study we have used cell models and quantitative drug metabolite analysis to define the role of the mitochondrion and cellular heme in the chemical and molecular mechanisms of cell death induced by artemisinin compounds. HeLa rho(0) cells, which are devoid of a functioning electron transport chain, were used to demonstrate that actively respiring mitochondria play an essential role in endoperoxide-induced cytotoxicity (artesunate IC(50) values, 48 h: HeLa cells, 6 +/- 3 muM; and HeLa rho(0) cells, 34 +/- 5 muM) via the generation of reactive oxygen species and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis but do not have any role in the reductive activation of the endoperoxide to cytotoxic carbon-centered radicals. However, using chemical modulators of heme synthesis (succinylacetone and protoporphyrin IX) and cellular iron content (holotransferrin), we have demonstrated definitively that free or protein-bound heme is responsible for intracellular activation of the endoperoxide group and that this is the chemical basis of cytotoxicity (IC(50) value and biomarker of bioactivation levels, respectively: 10beta-(p-fluorophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin alone, 0.36 +/- 0.20 muM and 11 +/- 5%; and with succinylacetone, >100 muM and 2 +/- 5%).},

   abstract = {Predicting the sub-cellular localization of proteins is an important task in bioinformatics, for which many standard prediction tools are available. While these tools are powerful in general and capable of predicting protein localization for the most common compartments, their performance strongly depends on the organism of interest. More importantly, there are special compartments, such as the apicoplast of apicomplexan parasites, for which these tools cannot provide a prediction at all. In the absence of a highly conserved targeting signal, even motif searches may not be able to provide a lead for the accurate prediction of protein localization for a compartment of interest. In order to approach difficult cases of that kind, we propose an alternative method that complements existing approaches by using a more targeted protein sequence model. Moreover, our method makes use of (weighted) measures for time series comparison. To demonstrate its performance, we use this method for predicting localization in special compartments of three different species, for which existing methods yield only sub-optimal results. As shown experimentally, our method is indeed capable of producing reliable predictions of sub-cellular localization for difficult cases, i.e. if training data is scarce and a potential protein targeting signal may not be well conserved.},

   abstract = {The crystal structure of yeast orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase) complexed with the inhibitor 6-hydroxyuridine 5'-phosphate (BMP) reveals the presence of a series of strong interactions between enzyme residues and functional groups of this ligand. Enzyme contacts with the phosphoribofuranosyl moiety of orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP) have been shown to contribute at least 16.6 kcal/mol of intrinsic binding free energy to the stabilization of the transition state for the reaction catalyzed by yeast ODCase. In addition to these enzyme-ligand contacts, active site residues contributed by both subunits of the dimeric enzyme are positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the 2'- and 3'-OH groups of the ligand's ribosyl moiety. These involve Thr-100 of one subunit and Asp-37 of the opposite subunit, respectively. To evaluate the contributions of these ribofuranosyl contacts to ground state and transition state stabilization, Thr-100 and Asp-37 were each mutated to alanine. Elimination of the enzyme's capacity to contact individual ribosyl OH groups reduced the k(cat)/K(m) value of the T100A enzyme by 60-fold and that of the D37A enzyme by 300-fold. Removal of the 2'-OH group from the substrate OMP decreased the binding affinity by less than a factor of 10, but decreased k(cat) by more that 2 orders of magnitude. Upon removal of the complementary hydroxymethyl group from the enzyme, little further reduction in k(cat)/K(m) for 2'-deoxyOMP was observed. To assess the contribution made by contacts involving both ribosyl hydroxyl groups at once, the ability of the D37A mutant enzyme to decarboxylate 2'-deoxyOMP was measured. The value of k(cat)/K(m) for this enzyme-substrate pair was 170 M(-1) s(-1), representing a decrease of more than 7.6 kcal/mol of binding free energy in the transition state. To the extent that electrostatic repulsion in the ground state can be tested by these simple alterations, the results do not lend obvious support to the view that electrostatic destabilization in the ground state enzyme-substrate complex plays a major role in catalysis.},

The crystal structure of the recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme has been determined in the absence and presence of the proposed transition state analog 6-hydroxyuridine 5'-phosphate, at a resolution of 2.1 A and 2.4 A, respectively. Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase folds as a TIM-barrel with the ligand binding site near the open end of the barrel. The binding of 6-hydroxyuridine 5'-phosphate is accompanied by protein loop movements that envelop the ligand almost completely, forming numerous favorable interactions with the phosphoryl group, the ribofuranosyl group, and the pyrimidine ring. Lysine-93 appears to be anchored in such a way as to optimize electrostatic interactions with developing negative charge at C-6 of the pyrimidine ring, and to donate the proton that replaces the carboxylate group at C-6 of the product. In addition, H-bonds from the active site to O-2 and O-4 help to delocalize negative charge in the transition state. Interactions between the enzyme and the phosphoribosyl group anchor the pyrimidine within the active site, helping to explain the phosphoribosyl group's remarkably large contribution to catalysis despite its distance from the site of decarboxylation.},

In the Y217A/R235A double mutant, activity is reduced more than 10(7)-fold.

For the D91A and K93A mutant enzymes, activity was reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude and substrate binding could not be detected by isothermal calorimetry. For the D96A mutant enzyme, k(cat) was reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude, and isothermal calorimetry indicated an 11-fold decrease in the affinity of this enzyme for the substrate in the ground state. For the K59A enzyme, k(cat) was reduced by a factor of 130, and K(m) had increased by a factor of 900. These results indicate that the integrity of the network of charged residues is essential for transition state stabilization.},

   abstract = {Enzymes are called upon to differ greatly in the difficulty of the tasks that they perform. The catalytic proficiency of an enzyme can be evaluated by comparing the second-order rate constant (kcat/Km) with the rate of the spontaneous reaction in neutral solution in the absence of a catalyst. The proficiencies of enzymes, measured in this way, are matched by their affinity constants for the altered substrate in the transition state. These values vary from approximately approximately 10(9) M(-1) for carbonic anhydrase to approximately 10(23) M(-1) for yeast orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (ODCase). ODCase turns its substrate over with a half-time of 18 ms, in a reaction that proceeds in its absence with a half-time of 78 million years in neutral solution. ODCase differs from other decarboxylases in that its catalytic activity does not depend on the presence of metals or other cofactors, or on the formation of a covalent bond to the substrate. Several mechanisms of transition state stabilization are considered in terms of ODCase crystal structures observed in the presence and absence of bound analogs of the substrate, transition state, and product. Very large connectivity effects are indicated by the results of experiments testing how transition state stabilization is affected by the truncation of binding determinants of the substrate and the active site.},

   abstract = {Following intracellular replication, the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii cause host cell cytolysis to facilitate parasite release and disease progression. Parasite exit from infected cells requires the interplay of parasite-derived proteins and host actin cytoskeletal changes; however, the host proteins underlying these changes remain obscure. We report the identification of a Galpha(q)-coupled host-signaling cascade required for the egress of both P. falciparum and T. gondii. Galpha(q)-coupled signaling results in protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated loss of the host cytoskeletal protein adducin and weakening of the cellular cytoskeleton. This cytoskeletal compromise induces catastrophic Ca(2+) influx mediated by the mechanosensitive cation channel TRPC6, which activates host calpain that proteolyzes the host cytoskeleton allowing parasite release. Reinforcing the feasibility of targeting host proteins as an antiparasitic strategy, mammalian PKC inhibitors demonstrated activity in murine models of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Importantly, an orally bioavailable PKC inhibitor prolonged survival in an experimental cerebral malaria model.},

These hybrid compounds showed high potency against both exoerythrocytic and erythrocytic forms of malaria parasites, comparable to representative trioxane-based counterparts. Furthermore, they efficiently blocked the development of the sporogonic cycle in the mosquito vector. The tetraoxane-based hybrid 5, containing an amide linker between the two moieties, effectively cleared a patent blood-stage P. berghei infection in mice after i.p. administration. Overall, these results indicate that peroxide-8-aminoquinoline hybrids are excellent starting points to develop an agent that conveys all the desired antimalarial multistage activities in a single chemical entity and, as such, with the potential to be used in malaria elimination campaigns.},

They posses an acidic matrix that contains several cations bound to phosphates, mainly present in the form of short and long polyphosphate chains. Their matrix is acidified through the action of proton pumps such as a vacuolar proton ATPase and a vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase. The calcium uptake occurs through a Ca2+/H+ counter transporting ATPase located in the membrane of the organelle. Acidocalcisomes have been identified in a variety of microorganisms, including Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium and Eimeria species, and in Toxoplasma gondii.

Furthermore, the molecular function of ATG8 in its novel workplace, the apicoplast, is totally unknown.

METHODS: OZ439 was administered as single oral daily doses of a capsule formulation (50-1200 mg) or an oral dispersion (400-1600 mg, fed and fasted states) and for up to 3 days as an oral dispersion (200-800 mg day(-1)). Plasma concentrations of OZ439 and its metabolites were measured by LC-MS. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of OZ439 was characterized by a t(max) of around 3 h, followed by a multiphasic profile with a terminal half-life of 25-30 h. The PK parameters were approximately dose proportional for each group and profiles of the metabolites followed a similar pattern to that of the parent compound. Following dosing for 3 days, accumulation was less than two-fold but steady-state was not achieved. In the presence of food, no effect was observed on the t(1/2) of OZ439 while the exposure was increased by 3 to 4.5-fold. Exposure was higher and inter-subject variability was reduced when OZ439 was administered as an oral dispersion compared with a capsule. The urinary clearance of OZ439 and its metabolites was found to be negligible and OZ439 did not induce CYP3A4. The antimalarial activity profiles of a subset of serum samples suggested that the major antimalarial activity originated from OZ439 rather than from any of the metabolites. CONCLUSION: The safety and pharmacokinetic profile of OZ439 merits progression to phase 2a proof of concept studies in the target population of acute uncomplicated malaria.},

LT-B with its native signal peptide (BSP) has been shown to accumulate in starch granules of transgenic maize kernels. To elucidate the targeting properties of the bacterial LT-B protein and BSP in plant systems, the subcellular localization of visual marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to LT-B and various combinations of signal peptides was examined in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic maize. Biochemical analysis indicates that the LT-B::GFP fusion proteins can assemble and fold properly retaining both the antigenicity of LT-B and the fluorescing properties of GFP. Maize kernel fractionation revealed that transgenic lines carrying BSP result in recombinant protein association with fibre and starch fractions. Confocal microscopy analysis indicates that the fusion proteins accumulate in the endomembrane system of plant cells in a signal peptide-dependent fashion. This is the first report providing evidence of the ability of a bacterial signal peptide to target proteins to the plant secretory pathway. The results provide important insights for further understanding the heterologous protein trafficking mechanisms and for developing effective strategies in molecular farming.},

This work describes fractionation by wet-milling of transgenic maize expressing the B subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT-B), a potent immunogen and candidate for oral vaccine and vaccine components. The LT-B gene was directed to express in seed by an endosperm specific promoter. Two steeping treatments, traditional steeping (TS, 0.2% SO(2) + 0.5% lactic acid) and water steeping (WS, water only), were evaluated to determine effects on recovery of functional LT-B in wet-milled fractions. The overall recovery of the LT-B protein from WS treatment was 1.5-fold greater than that from TS treatment. In both steeping types, LT-B was distributed similarly among the fractions, resulting in enrichment of functional LT-B in fine fiber, coarse fiber and pericarp fractions by concentration factors of 1.5 to 8 relative to the whole kernels on a per-mass basis. Combined with endosperm-specific expression and secretory pathway targeting, wet-milling enables enrichment of high-value recombinant proteins in low-value fractions, such as the fine fiber, and co-utilization of remaining fractions in alternative industrial applications.},

Furthermore, the obturation time for the two techniques was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven roots with oval and ribbon-shaped canals were prepared using Profile Ni-Ti rotary files. After preparation, the roots were randomly allocated to two groups according to root filling technique. All roots were filled with AH plus and gutta-percha. Group 1 was filled using LCT (n = 34) and group 2 was filled using HT (n = 33). The obturation time was measured in 30 cases evenly distributed between the two techniques. Voids in relation to the root canal fillings were assessed using cross-section images from Micro-computed Tomography scans. RESULTS: All root canal fillings had voids. Permutation test showed no statistically significant difference between the two root filling techniques in relation to presence of voids (p = 0.092). A statistically significant difference in obturation time between the two techniques was found (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study found no statistically significant difference in percentage of voids between two root filling techniques. A 40% reduction in obturation time was found for the HT compared to the LCT.},

   abstract = {We report the study of the dynamics of substrate utilization by the genetic modified strain Yarrowia lipolytica H222-S4(p67ICL1) T5. In contrast to its wild-type equivalent, this recombinant strain is able to excrete the sucrose cleaving enzyme invertase. Both the sucrose degradation rate and the glucose and fructose consumption rate have been investigated. In all experiments, satisfied amounts of invertase were produced so that all sucrose was cleaved into its monomers. While glucose and fructose as sole carbon sources were consumed with the same uptake rate, a clear preference for glucose uptake was detected in cultivations with sucrose as sole carbon source or mixed substrates when compared with fructose. Nevertheless, no real diauxie could be observed because of partly simultaneous consumption of both monosaccharides. Fructose being present in the cultivation medium at the beginning of the fermentation led to the retardation of glucose uptake. This effect was observed for various fructose starting concentrations in the range of 5-85 g/l.},

   abstract = {The genetic basis for differences in TSH sensitivity between two rat strains was examined using consomic rats generated from original strains salt-sensitive Dahl (SS) (TSH 1.8 +/- 0.1 ng/ml; free T(4) index 4.9 +/- 0.4) and Brown Norwegian (BN) (TSH 5.5 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, P < 0.05; free T(4) index 4.3 +/- 0.1, P not significant). Consomic rats SSBN6 [BN chromosome (CH) 6 placed in SS rat] and SSBN2 (BN CH 2 placed in SS rat) have TSH concentrations intermediate between pure SS and BN strains (2.9 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). Candidate genes on rat CH 2 included TSH beta-subunit and on CH 6 the TSH receptor (TSHR). TSH from sera of BN, SS, SSBN6, and SSBN2 strains had similar in vitro bioactivity suggesting that the cause for the variable TSH concentrations was not due to an altered TSH. Physiological response to TSH was measured by changes in serum T(4) concentrations upon administration of bovine TSH (bTSH). Rat strain SS had a greater T(4) response to bTSH than BN (change in T(4), 1.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 microg/dl, P < 0.005), suggesting reduced thyrocyte sensitivity to TSH in BN. Sequencing of the TSHR coding region revealed an amino acid difference in BN (Q46R). This substitution is unlikely to contribute to the strain difference in serum TSH because both TSHR variants were equally expressed at the cell surface of transfected cells and responsive to bTSH. Given similar TSH activity and similar TSHR structure, TSHR mRNA expression in thyroid tissue was quantitated by real-time PCR. BN had 54 +/- 5% the total TSHR expression compared to SS (100 +/- 7%, P < 0.0001), when corrected for GAPDH expression, a difference confirmed at the protein level. Therefore, the higher TSH level in the BN strain appears to reflect an adjustment of the feedback loop to reduced thyrocyte sensitivity to TSH secondary to reduced TSHR expression. These strains of rat provide a model to study the cis- and trans-acting factors underlying the difference in TSHR expression.},

   abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for normal development, growth and metabolism. Its effects were thought to be principally mediated through triiodothyronine (T3), acting as a ligand for the nuclear TH receptors (TRs) alpha and beta residing on thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the promoter of TH target genes. In this classical model of TH action, T3 binding to TRs leads to recruitment of basal transcription factors and increased transcription of TH responsive genes.Recently, the concept of TH action on gene expression has become more diverse and now includes nonclassical actions of T3 and T4: T3 has been shown to activate PI3K via the TRs, which ultimately increases transcription of certain genes, e.g. HIF-1alpha. Additionally, both T3 and thyroxine (T4) can bind to a membrane integrin, alphavbeta3, which leads to activation of the PI3K and MAPK signal transduction pathways and finally also increases gene transcription, e.g. of the FGF2 gene. Therefore, these initially nongenomic, nonclassical actions seem to serve as additional interfaces for transcriptional regulation by TH. Aim of this perspective is to summarize the genes that are currently known to be induced by nonclassical TH action and the mechanisms involved.},

   abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) action is mediated principally through binding of the hormone ligand, 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3), to TH receptors (TRs). This hormone-receptor interaction recruits other proteins to form complexes that regulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequences in the promoter of target genes. We recently described an extranuclear mechanism of TH action that consists of the association of TH-liganded TRbeta with p85alpha [regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)] in the cytosol and subsequent activation of the PI3K, generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. This initiates the activation of a signaling cascade by phosphorylation of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its substrate p70(S6K), leading to the stimulation of ZAKI-4alpha synthesis, a calcineurin inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that this same mechanism leads to induction of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha), and its target genes, glucose transporter (GLUT)1, platelet-type phosphofructokinase (PFKP), and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4. These genes are of special interest, because their products have important roles in cellular glucose metabolism, from glucose uptake (GLUT1) to glycolysis (PFKP) and lactate export (MCT4). These results demonstrate that the TH-TRbeta complex can exert a non-genomic action in the cytosol leading to changes in gene expression by direct (HIF-1alpha) and indirect (ZAKI-4alpha, GLUT1, PFKP) means.},

   abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) effects are mediated through T(3), which regulates gene expression by binding to the nuclear TH receptors, TRalpha and TRbeta. Using microarrays and real-time PCR we found mRNAs of the following genes increased in response to T(3) in a TRbeta-specific manner: the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, its target genes glucose transporter (GLUT)1 and platelet-type phosphofructokinase (PFKP), and the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4. The products of these genes have important roles in cellular glucose metabolism. HIF-1alpha expression and activity can be regulated through phosphatidylinositol-OH-3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPK signaling; thus the possibility of alternative, nonnuclear pathways of TH action was raised. We examined the involvement of these pathways in mediating TH effects by treating human skin fibroblasts with 2 nm T(3) in the absence or presence of either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the MAPK inhibitor PD98059. T(3) induced HIF-1alpha mRNA by 2.7-fold (+/-0.4; P < 0.013). This increase was completely abrogated by LY294002 (1.1 +/- 0.1; nonsignificant = 0.57), but preserved in the presence of PD98059 (2.2 +/- 0.2; P < 0.009). Western blotting confirmed these results at the protein level, indicating dependency on the PI3K pathway. The same pattern of response was observed for GLUT1, PFKP, and MCT4 expression. To examine whether HIF-1alpha is directly induced, we used the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). T(3) induction of HIF-1alpha mRNA was not affected by CHX, whereas T(3) effect on GLUT1, PFKP, and MCT4 mRNA was completely abrogated by CHX. These results demonstrate that cytosolic activation of the PI3K signaling pathway has a role in TH-mediated direct (HIF-1alpha) and indirect (GLUT1, PFKP, MCT4) gene expression, and possibly provides a link between TH and cellular glucose metabolism in human fibroblasts.},

   abstract = {Human skin fibroblasts are readily accessible cells for propagation in culture without transformation that can serve for direct pathophysiology studies in subjects with inherited diseases. We thus examined by quantitative fluorescent cDNA microarray analysis the effect of thyroid hormone (TH) on the expression of more than 15,000 genes in fibroblasts of two normal individuals. Fibroblasts from two subjects with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) due to mutations in the TH receptor-beta gene were used to confirm the specificity of the hormonal effect by the ability to discriminate between normal cells and cells with a defect in TH action. Microarray analysis identified 148 genes induced by 1.4-fold or more and five genes repressed to 0.7 or less 24 h after treatment with 2 x 10(-9) M T(3). Taking into account duplicate genes, these represented 91 up-regulated and five down-regulated genes, respectively. Confirmation by real-time PCR was obtained in eight of 10 induced and two of three repressed genes that were tested. Further evidence for T(3)-specific induction was provided by a graded dose response absent in fibroblasts from the patients with RTH. The following genes not previously known to be induced by TH were identified and validated: aldo-keto reductase family 1 C1-3, collagen type VI alpha 3, member RAS oncogene family brain antigen RAB3B, platelet phosphofructokinase, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, and enolase 1 alpha. These genes as well as three known to be TH regulated in other species and found in this study also in human cells (glucose transporter 1, solute carrier family 16 member 3, and basic transcription element-binding protein 1) have a variety of regulatory functions in development and metabolism. TH seems to induce these genes by initiating either genomic or nongenomic mechanisms. Surprisingly, TH-mediated down-regulation of fibroblast growth factor 7 and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B persisted in fibroblasts from patients with RTH. This first systematic study of TH-mediated gene expression in normal human cells identifies several new TH-responsive genes and demonstrates that skin fibroblasts are suitable for the study of TH action in health and disease.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: T(4)-binding globulin (TBG) is the main transport protein for T(4) in blood and a member of the superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors. So far, 14 mutations leading to familial complete TBG deficiency have been reported. Eleven of these are caused by mutations leading to truncation of the molecule, and three are caused by single amino acid substitutions. OBJECTIVE: We report and study the complete deficiency TBG variant found in a patient from NeuIsenburg, Germany (TBG-CDNI). METHODS: Direct DNA sequencing was used to identify the TBG-CDNI mutation in the propositus, which was confirmed by allele-specific amplification. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes was used to study the secretion defect of TBG-CDNI and several variants by Western blot and T(4)-binding assay. RESULTS: The deletion of two nucleotides in codon 384 (1211_1212delTC) causes a frameshift altering the last 11 residues, introduces a new glycosylation site, and elongates the molecule by seven new amino acids. In contrast to normal TBG, TBG-CDNI was not secreted by Xenopus oocytes. Elongation of normal TBG by seven alanines did not affect its secretion or binding properties. On the other hand, neither disruption of its new glycosylation site nor termination of TBG-CDNI at the normal length repaired its secretion defect. CONCLUSIONS: In this first late termination variant of complete TBG deficiency, alteration of beta-strand 5B, located in the core of the molecule, rather than elongation of the molecule or introduction of a new glycosylation site, suffices to disrupt secretion of TBG-CDNI.},

   abstract = {Thyroid hormones (THs) may play a role in diseases other than hyper- and hypothyroidism. Several lines of evidence suggest tumor-promoting effects of TH and TH receptors. They are possibly mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and MAPK and involve among others stimulation of angiogenesis via alphavbeta3. Thus, an increased risk for colon, lung, prostate, and breast cancer with lower TSH has been demonstrated in epidemiological studies, even suggesting a TH dose effect on cancer occurrence. Furthermore, higher TH levels were associated with an advanced clinical stage of breast and prostate cancer. In rodent models, TH stimulated growth and metastasis of tumor transplants, whereas hypothyroidism had opposite effects. In clinical studies of glioblastoma and head and neck cancer, hypothyroid patients showed longer survival than euthyroid patients. Also, patients with renal cell cancer that were treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib and developed hypothyroidism in due course showed significantly longer survival than patients that remained euthyroid. Development of hypothyroidism was an independent predictor for survival in two studies. Yet, it is still possible that hypothyroidism is only a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy and does not positively influence treatment outcome by itself. Future cancer treatment studies, especially with substances that can induce hypothyroidism, should therefore be designed in a way that allows for an analysis of thyroid function status and its contribution on treatment outcome.},

Ttf1+/- mice have also poor coordination and increased serum TSH concentration (205 +/- 22 vs. 92 +/- 12 mU/liter; P < 0.001) and slightly lower T4 (46 +/- 3 vs. 63 +/- 6 nmol/liter; P < 0.02) as compared with Ttf1+/+ mice. To determine whether the hypothyroidism is of central or primary origin, we examined the bioactivity of TSH, thyroidal response to exogenous TSH and the expression of genes regulated by TTF1. TSH bioactivity was normal, but T4 response to a low but not high dose of TSH was significantly reduced in the Ttf1+/- mice (5.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 15.3 +/- 4.1 nmol/liter; P < 0.03), indicating a reduced thyroidal response. Thyroid mRNAs were measured by real-time PCR (Ttf1+/+ littermates = 100%). Ttf1+/- mice had half the levels of TTF1 mRNA (54 +/- 9; P < 0.01) and protein, confirming their haploinsufficiency. Significantly lower levels of mRNAs were observed for two of the three genes with TTF1 cis elements: TSH receptor (TSHr, 57 +/- 4%; P < 0.002), thyroglobulin (63 +/- 7%; P < 0.005), but not thyroid peroxidase (81 +/- 12%; P > 0.05). No significant difference between the two genotypes was found for Pax8, sodium iodide symporter, and iodothyronine deiodinase 1. These results show that Ttf1 haploinsufficiency causes a reduction in the expression of TSHr and thyroglobulin, genes with TTF1 binding sites in their promoter regions. The low TSHr is only partially compensated by an increase in TSH secretion because T4 remains mildly reduced. However, administration of a larger amount of TSH obliterates the response differences by saturating a reduced amount of receptor.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge on the action of thyroid hormone (TH) is augmented by the study of tissue responses to TH in vitro. In order to support the growth of cells in vitro, calf serum (CS) is usually added to the medium to provide necessary nutrients and growth factors. However, the content of endogenous TH in the CS may obfuscate changes with small doses of TH. We therefore compared the use of TH-depleted medium, either by resin treatment (stripped-CS) or by the use of CS from a thyroidectomized calf (TxCS) for gene expression studies. METHODS: We describe the method for preparing a thyroidectomized calf, harvesting the blood and preparing the serum. We utilized methimazole in conjunction with the thyroidectomy to prevent TH synthesis in the event of regrowth of the thyroid remnant. RESULTS: Total triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine concentrations in TxCS were low at <30 ng/dL and <1 microg/dL, respectively. We compared the effect of T(3) on basic transcription element-binding protein (BTEB)1 and stanniocalcin (STC)-1 mRNA expression in human fibroblasts from a normal individual and a subject with resistance to TH (RTH) cultured in stripped-CS to TxCS and demonstrated that with stripped-CS and TxCS differences in the BTEB1 and STC-1 expression of normal and RTH fibroblasts could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: Both stripped-CS and TxCS are suitable to detect subtle differences in TH responsiveness between normal and RTH human skin fibroblasts, yet TxCS is not as costly as stripped-CS and relatively easy to prepare.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Menopause-induced estrogen deficiency increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is related to a shift in regional fat distribution. We tested the hypothesis that estrogen-like isoflavones in soy protein isolate (SPI+) would lessen both regional fat gain and lean loss compared with isoflavone-poor soy (SPI-). DESIGN: Perimenopausal participants (N = 69) were randomly assigned (double-blind) to 24 weeks of treatment (40 g soy or whey protein per day): SPI+ (n = 24), SPI- (n = 24), or whey control (n = 21); each participant had blood drawn in the fasted (12 hours) state, had physical activity assessed, and kept a 5-day food diary. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to examine the effects of SPI+ on regional fat and lean tissue distribution changes in the waist, hip, and thigh regions. RESULTS: Mean body mass increased (P < 0.01) in each group, but treatment had no effect on gain in overall body mass, fat mass, or lean mass using analysis of variance. In all treatment groups combined, lean mass increased in each region; fat mass increased only in the waist region. Treatment had an effect (P = 0.039) on hip lean mass and a marginal effect (P = 0.077) on thigh fat. Regression analyses revealed that SPI+ diminished the increase in thigh fat (P = 0.018) and heightened the increase in hip lean (P = 0.035) mass. Carbohydrate intake (P = 0.006) and cohort (reflective of season; P = 0.011) contributed to the gain in thigh fat. Total protein intake (P = 0.0012), plasma insulin (P = 0.0034), and physical activity (P = 0.047) contributed to the gain in hip lean mass. CONCLUSIONS: Gain in hip lean mass was greater (P = 0.014) in SPI+ than other groups, but SPI+ did not reduce the disease-promoting menopausal shift in regional fat mass.},

   abstract = {Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase important in B-lymphocyte development, differentiation, and signaling. Btk is a member of the Tec family of kinases. Mutations in the Btk gene lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid) in mice. Activation of Btk triggers a cascade of signaling events that culminates in the generation of calcium mobilization and fluxes, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and transcriptional regulation involving nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). In B cells, NF-kappaB was shown to bind to the Btk promoter and induce transcription, whereas the B-cell receptor-dependent NF-kappaB signaling pathway requires functional Btk. Moreover, Btk activation is tightly regulated by a plethora of other signaling proteins including protein kinase C (PKC), Sab/SH3BP5, and caveolin-1. For example, the prolyl isomerase Pin1 negatively regulates Btk by decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation and steady state levels of Btk. It is intriguing that PKC and Pin1, both of which are negative regulators, bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of Btk. To this end, we describe here novel mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain investigated for their transforming capacity. In particular, we show that the mutant D43R behaves similar to E41K, already known to possess such activity.},

   abstract = {Several candidate genes along androgen pathway have been suggested to affect prostate cancer risk but no single gene seems to be overwhelmingly important for a large fraction of the patients. In this study, we first screened for variants in candidate genes and then chose to explore the association between 18 variants and prostate cancer risk by genotyping DNA samples from unselected (n = 847) and familial (n = 121) prostate cancer patients and population controls (n = 923). We identified a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CYP19A1 gene, T201M, with a mild significant association with prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR), 2.04; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.03-4.03; P = 0.04]. Stratified analysis revealed that this risk was most apparent in patients with organ-confined (T(1)-T(2)) and low-grade (WHO grade 1) tumors (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 2.33-12.6; P < 0.0001). In contrast, CYP17A1 -34T>C alteration was associated with moderate to poorly differentiated (WHO grade 2-3) organ-confined disease (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-1.83; P = 0.007). We also tested a multigenic model of prostate cancer risk by calculating the joint effect of CYP19A1 T201M with five other common SNPs. Individuals carrying both the CYP19A1 and KLK3 -252A>G variant alleles had a significantly increased risk for prostate cancer (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.10-7.49; P = 0.03). In conclusion, our results suggest that several SNPs along the androgen pathway, especially in CYP19A1 and CYP17A1, may influence prostate cancer development and progression. These genes may have different contributions to distinct clinical subsets as well as combinatorial effects in others illustrating that profiling and joint analysis of several genes along each pathway may be needed to understand genetic contributions to prostate cancer etiology.},

Here we describe a newly cultured organism that has ultrastructural features typical for alveolates, is phylogenetically related to apicomplexans, and contains a photosynthetic plastid. The plastid is surrounded by four membranes, is pigmented by chlorophyll a, and uses the codon UGA to encode tryptophan in the psbA gene. This genetic feature has been found only in coccidian apicoplasts and various mitochondria. The UGA-Trp codon and phylogenies of plastid and nuclear ribosomal RNA genes indicate that the organism is the closest known photosynthetic relative to apicomplexan parasites and that its plastid shares an origin with the apicoplasts. The discovery of this organism provides a powerful model with which to study the evolution of parasitism in Apicomplexa.},

   abstract = {Calcium is relevant for several vital functions in apicomplexan parasites, including host cell invasion, parasite motility and differentiation. The ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and calcium-rich acidocalcisomes have been identified as major calcium stores. Other potential calcium-storage organelles include the Golgi, the mitochondrion, the apicoplast and the recently described plant-like vacuole in Toxoplasma gondii. Compared with most eukaryotic systems, apicomplexan parasites contain a reduced number of calcium-related genes, a vast majority of which remain uncharacterized. Several Ca(2)(+)-ATPases have been described in apicomplexans, several of which are annotated in the different genomes. There is experimental evidence for an IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-dependent calcium response in Plasmodium spp. and T. gondii, although no IP3 or ryanodine receptors have been identified. Genes encoding potential calcium channels are present in T. gondi, but not in Plasmodium spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. Effector calcium-binding proteins including calmodulins and CDPK (calcium-dependent protein kinase) genes mainly found in plants have also been described. The characterized CDPKs were found to play important roles in protein secretion, host cell invasion and parasite differentiation. Taken together, the available information on calcium storage and function in apicomplexans, although fragmented, suggest the existence of unique calcium-mediated pathways in these parasites. An in-depth functional characterization of the apicomplexan calcium-related genes could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets, and will improve our understanding of the role of calcium in parasite development and virulence.},

The HSLs are produced by gram-negative bacteria and act as intercellular signals inducing density-dependent gene expression. Compared with the multi-step procedures previously reported, which included chemical extraction, purification and the use of Escherichia coli HSL biosensors, this on-line LC-MS-MS method is fast and detects 11 HSLs. Its speed and robustness allow the analysis of a large number of samples without loss of performance (no signal variation for a control sample after 90 chromatographic injections). The selectivity is based on the MS-MS fragment ions of the molecular [M+H]- ions and on their relative intensities. For quantification, the m/z 102 ion, specific for the lactone ring and detected with a good signal-to-noise ratio, allows low detection limits even in complex matrix samples (0.28 up to 9.3 pmol). Moreover, this method allows the quantification of 11 HSLs whatever their chemical structure, substituted or not. The protocol was applied to Vibrio vulnificus, a marine bacterium. Six HSLs were detected and quantified with relative standard deviations for repeatability of < 10%.},

Interactions of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) with endothelium in aorta are especially important in the processes contribute to the pathogenesis of severe malaria. Nitric oxide (NO) reduces endothelial expression of receptors/adhesion molecules used by pRBC to adhere to vascular endothelium, and reduces cytoadherence of pRBC to vascular endothelium. Cassiarin A 1 showed vasorelaxation activity against rat aortic ring, which may be related with NO production. A series of a hydroxyl and a nitrogen-substituted derivatives and a dehydroxy derivative of 1 have been synthesized as having potent antimalarials against P. falciparum with vasodilator activity, which may reduce cytoadherence of pRBC to vascular endothelium. Cassiarin A 1 exhibited a potent antimalarial activity and a high selectivity index in vitro, suggesting that the presence of a hydroxyl and a nitrogen atom without any substituents may be important to show antimalarial activity. Relative to cassiarin A, a methoxy derivative showed more potent vasorelaxant activity, although it did not show improvement for inhibition of P. falciparum in vitro.

In vitro cultures have paved the way to exploit the basic biology of these organisms, and had a major impact on the development of tools for diagnostic purposes. With the aid of in vitro cultivation, studies on host-parasite interactions, on factors involved in innate resistance, stage conversion and differentiation, genetics and transfection technology, vaccine candidates and drug effectiveness could be carried out. The use of transgenic parasites has facilitated high-throughput screening of anti-microbial compounds that are active against the proliferative stages.

   abstract = {Apicomplexa are protist parasites of tremendous medical and economic importance, causing millions of deaths and billions of dollars in losses each year. Apicomplexan-related diseases may be controlled via inhibition of essential enzymes. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) provides the only de novo means of synthesizing deoxyribonucleotides, essential precursors for DNA replication and repair. RNR has long been the target of antibacterial and antiviral therapeutics. However, targeting this ubiquitous protein in eukaryotic pathogens may be problematic unless these proteins differ significantly from that of their respective host. The typical eukaryotic RNR enzymes belong to class Ia, and the holoenzyme consists minimally of two R1 and two R2 subunits (alpha(2)beta(2)). We generated a comparative, annotated, structure-based, multiple-sequence alignment of R2 subunits, identified a clade of R2 subunits unique to Apicomplexa, and determined its phylogenetic position. Our analyses revealed that the apicomplexan-specific sequences share characteristics with both class I R2 and R2lox proteins. The putative radical-harboring residue, essential for the reduction reaction by class Ia R2-containing holoenzymes, was not conserved within this group. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that class Ia subunits are not monophyletic and consistently placed the apicomplexan-specific clade sister to the remaining class Ia eukaryote R2 subunits. Our research suggests that the novel apicomplexan R2 subunit may be a promising candidate for chemotherapeutic-induced inhibition as it differs greatly from known eukaryotic host RNRs and may be specifically targeted.},

   abstract = {Protein design experiments have shown that the use of specific subsets of amino acids can produce foldable proteins. This prompts the question of whether there is a minimal amino acid alphabet which could be used to fold all proteins. In this work we make an analogy between sequence patterns which produce foldable sequences and those which make it possible to detect structural homologs by aligning sequences, and use it to suggest the possible size of such a reduced alphabet. We estimate that reduced alphabets containing 10-12 letters can be used to design foldable sequences for a large number of protein families. This estimate is based on the observation that there is little loss of the information necessary to pick out structural homologs in a clustered protein sequence database when a suitable reduction of the amino acid alphabet from 20 to 10 letters is made, but that this information is rapidly degraded when further reductions in the alphabet are made.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites rely on calcium-mediated signaling for a variety of vital functions including protein secretion, motility, cell invasion, and differentiation. These functions are controlled by a variety of specialized systems for uptake and release of calcium, which acts as a second messenger, and on the functions of calcium-dependent proteins. Defining these systems in parasites has been complicated by their evolutionary distance from model organisms and practical concerns in working with small, and somewhat fastidious cells. Comparative genomic analyses of Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. reveal several interesting adaptations for calcium-related processes in parasites. Apicomplexans contain several P-type Ca2+ ATPases including an ER-type reuptake mechanism (SERCA), which is the proposed target of artemisinin. All three organisms also contain several genes related to Golgi PMR-like calcium transporters, and a Ca2+/H+ exchanger, while plasma membrane-type (PMCA) Ca2+ ATPases and voltage-dependent calcium channels are exclusively found in T. gondii. Pharmacological evidence supports the presence of IP3 and ryanodine channels for calcium-mediated release. Collectively these systems regulate calcium homeostasis and release calcium to act as a signal. Downstream responses are controlled by a family of EF-hand containing calcium binding proteins including calmodulin, and an array of centrin and caltractin-like genes. Most surprising, apicomplexans contain a diversity of calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), which are commonly found in plants. Toxoplasma contains more than 20 CDPK or CDPK-like proteases, while Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium have fewer than half this number. Several of these CDPKs have been shown to play vital roles in protein secretion, invasion, and differentiation, indicating that disruption of calcium-regulated pathways may provide a novel means for selective inhibition of parasites.},

   abstract = {Signal peptides are short peptides located at the N-terminus of secreted proteins. They characteristically have three domains; a basic region at the N-terminus (n-region), a central hydrophobic core (h-region) and a carboxy-terminal cleavage region (c-region). Although hundreds of different signal peptides have been identified, it has not been completely understood how their features enable signal peptides to influence protein expression. Antibody-derived signal peptides are often used to prepare recombinant antibodies expressed by eukaryotic cells, especially Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, when prokaryotic Escherichia coli (E. coli) are utilized in drug discovery processes, such as for phage display selection or antibody humanization, signal peptides have been selected separately due to the differences in the expression systems between the species. In this study, we successfully established a signal peptide that enables a functional antibody to be expressed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells by focusing on the importance of having an Ala residue in the c-region of the signal sequence. We found that changing Ser to Ala at only two positions significantly augmented the anti-HER2 antigen binding fragment (Fab) expression in E. coli. In addition, this altered signal peptide also retained the ability to express functional anti-HER2 antibody in CHO cells. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the signal peptide can promote functional antibody expression in both prokaryotic E. coli and eukaryotic CHO cells. This finding will contribute to the understanding of signal peptides and accelerate therapeutic antibody research.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium is of major concern today. Effective vaccines or successful applications of RNAi-based strategies for the treatment of malaria are currently unavailable. An unexplored area in the field of malaria research is the development of DNA-targeting drugs that can specifically interact with parasitic DNA and introduce deleterious changes, leading to loss of vital genome function and parasite death. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Advances in the development of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) with engineered DNA recognition domains allow us to design and develop nuclease of high target sequence specificity with a mega recognition site that typically occurs only once in the genome. Moreover, cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) can cross the cell plasma membrane and deliver conjugated protein, nucleic acid, or any other cargo to the cytoplasm, nucleus, or mitochondria. This article proposes that a drug from the combination of the CPP and ZFN systems can effectively enter the intracellular parasite, introduce deleterious changes in its genome, and eliminate the parasite from the infected cells. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Availability of a DNA-binding motif for more than 45 triplets and its modular nature, with freedom to change number of fingers in a ZFN, makes development of customized ZFN against diverse target DNA sequence of any gene feasible. Since the Plasmodium genome is highly AT rich, there is considerable sequence site diversity even for the structurally and functionally conserved enzymes between Plasmodium and humans. CPP can be used to deliver ZFN to the intracellular nucleus of the parasite. Signal-peptide-based heterologous protein translocation to Plasmodium-infected RBCs (iRBCs) and different Plasmodium organelles have been achieved. With successful fusion of CPP with mitochondrial- and nuclear-targeting peptides, fusion of CPP with 1 more Plasmodium cell membrane translocation peptide seems achievable. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Targeting of the Plasmodium genome using ZFN has great potential for the development of anti-malarial drugs. It allows the development of a single drug against all malarial infections, including multidrug-resistant strains. Availability of multiple ZFN target sites in a single gene will provide alternative drug target sites to combat the development of resistance in the future.},

Here we introduce LOCtree, a hierarchical system combining support vector machines (SVMs) and other prediction methods. LOCtree predicts the subcellular compartment of a protein by mimicking the mechanism of cellular sorting and exploiting a variety of sequence and predicted structural features in its input. Currently LOCtree does not predict localization for membrane proteins, since the compositional properties of membrane proteins significantly differ from those of non-membrane proteins. While any information about function can be used by the system, we present estimates of performance that are valid when only the amino acid sequence of a protein is known. When evaluated on a non-redundant test set, LOCtree achieved sustained levels of 74% accuracy for non-plant eukaryotes, 70% for plants, and 84% for prokaryotes. We rigorously benchmarked LOCtree in comparison to the best alternative methods for localization prediction. LOCtree outperformed all other methods in nearly all benchmarks. Localization assignments using LOCtree agreed quite well with data from recent large-scale experiments. Our preliminary analysis of a few entirely sequenced organisms, namely human (Homo sapiens), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and weed (Arabidopsis thaliana) suggested that over 35% of all non-membrane proteins are nuclear, about 20% are retained in the cytosol, and that every fifth protein in the weed resides in the chloroplast.},

Here we show the bacterial expression, purification, and reconstitution of proteolytically active signal peptide peptidase (SPP), a membrane-embedded enzyme in the presenilin family of aspartyl proteases. This finding formally proves that, unlike presenilin, SPP does not require any additional proteins for proteolysis. Surprisingly, the conserved C-terminal half of SPP is sufficient for proteolytic activity; purification and reconstitution of this engineered fragment of several SPP orthologues revealed that this region defines a functional domain for an intramembrane aspartyl protease. The discovery of minimal requirements for intramembrane proteolysis should facilitate mechanistic and structural analysis and help define general biochemical principles of hydrolysis in a hydrophobic environment.},

The three domains seem to have duplicated together, since the phylogenetic analysis using parsimony gave almost identical evolutionary trees for the separate domains and the multidomain complexes. The congruence analysis of the sequences for the separate domains also suggested that the domains have coevolved. There are several reasons for the domains to appear in a cluster. Kinases are regulated in many ways, and the presence of SH2 and SH3 domains at proper positions is crucial. Because all three domains can recognize different parts of ligands and substrates, their evolution has been interconnected. The reasons for the clustering and coevolution of the three domains in protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are discussed.},

Compared with earlier years, we found a significant decrease in chloroquine in vitro and in genotypic resistances (> 50% and > 65%, respectively, in previous studies) with only 23% of isolates showing resistance.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Can sequence segments coding for subcellular targeting or for posttranslational modifications occur in proteins that are not substrates in either of these processes? Although considerable effort has been invested in achieving low false-positive prediction rates, even accurate sequence-analysis tools for the recognition of these motifs generate a small but noticeable number of protein hits that lack the appropriate biological context but cannot be rationalized as false positives. RESULTS: We show that the carboxyl termini of a set of definitely non-peroxisomal proteins with predicted peroxisomal targeting signals interact with the peroxisomal matrix protein receptor peroxin 5 (PEX5) in a yeast two-hybrid test. Moreover, we show that examples of these proteins - chicken lysozyme, human tyrosinase and the yeast mitochondrial ribosomal protein L2 (encoded by MRP7) - are imported into peroxisomes in vivo if their original sorting signals are disguised. We also show that even prokaryotic proteins can contain peroxisomal targeting sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, functional localization signals can evolve in unrelated protein sequences as a result of neutral mutations, and subcellular targeting is hierarchically organized, with signal accessibility playing a decisive role. The occurrence of silent functional motifs in unrelated proteins is important for the development of sequence-based function prediction tools and the interpretation of their results. Silent functional signals have the potential to acquire importance in future evolutionary scenarios and in pathological conditions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hereditary pheochromocytoma is associated with germline mutations of a set of susceptibility genes to which the TMEM127 gene has recently been added. Patients with TMEM127 mutations have been thus far exclusively identified with adrenal tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A population-based series of 48 consecutive individuals from the European-American Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma Registry with multiple paraganglial tumors and, of these, one extraadrenal paraganglial tumor were selected for this study. They all had normal results when screened for germline mutations of the genes RET, VHL, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD. Germline mutation analysis of the TMEM127 gene included a search for intragenic mutations and large rearrangements. RESULTS: Of the 48 eligible patients with extraadrenal paraganglial tumors, two (4.2%) were found to have TMEM127 mutations. One patient had multiple head and neck paraganglioma and one retroperitoneal extraadrenal and adrenal tumor. CONCLUSION: TMEM127 germline mutations confer risks of extraadrenal paraganglial tumors in addition to the documented adrenal pheochromocytoma. Thus, surveillance for extraadrenal and adrenal paraganglial tumors is likely warranted in TMEM127 mutation carriers, although the true prevalence should be evaluated in patients with extraadrenal paraganglial tumors.},

   abstract = {Lactococcus lactis is an attractive vehicle for biotechnological production of proteins and clinical delivery of therapeutics. In many such applications using this host, it is desirable to maximize secretion of recombinant proteins into the extracellular space, which is typically achieved by using the native signal peptide from a major secreted lactococcal protein, Usp45. In order to further increase protein secretion from L. lactis, inherent limitations of the Usp45 signal peptide (Usp45sp) must be elucidated. Here, we performed extensive mutagenesis on Usp45sp to probe the effects of both the mRNA sequence (silent mutations) and the peptide sequence (amino acid substitutions) on secretion. We screened signal peptides based on their resulting secretion levels of Staphylococcus aureus nuclease and further evaluated them for secretion of Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase. Silent mutations alone gave an increase of up to 16% in the secretion of alpha-amylase through a mechanism consistent with relaxed mRNA folding around the ribosome binding site and enhanced translation. Targeted amino acid mutagenesis in Usp45sp, combined with additional silent mutations from the best clone in the initial screen, yielded an increase of up to 51% in maximum secretion of alpha-amylase while maintaining secretion at lower induction levels. The best sequence from our screen preserves the tripartite structure of the native signal peptide but increases the positive charge of the n-region. Our study presents the first example of an engineered L. lactis signal peptide with a higher secretion yield than Usp45sp and, more generally, provides strategies for further enhancing protein secretion in bacterial hosts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria healthcare policy change in Kenya aimed at improving the control of malaria but faced a number of challenges in implementation related to marketing of the drugs. This research investigated the effect of the change of the national malaria policy on drug sales and strategic marketing responses of antimalarial pharmaceutical companies in Kenya. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional design was employed to describe the existing state of antimalarials market in Kenya after the change of the malaria healthcare policy. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Policy change did result in an increase in the sales of Coartem(R). Novartis Pharma recorded a 97% growth in sales of Coartem(R) between 2003 and 2004. However, this increase was not experienced by all the companies. Further, SPs (which had been replaced as first-line therapy for malaria) registered good sales. In most cases, these sales were higher than the sales of Coartem(R). Generally, the sales contribution of SPs and generic antimalarial medicines exceeded that of Coartem(R) for most distributors. The most common change made to marketing strategies by distributors (62.5%) was to increase imports of antimalarials. A total of 40% of the manufacturers preferred to increase their budgetary allocation for marketing activities. In view of the fact that continued sale of SP drugs and limited availability of AL poses the risk of increasing the incidence of malaria in Kenya, it is therefore, recommended that pharmacy surveillance systems be strengthened to ensure drugs that have been rendered non-viable or that prescription-only medicines are not sold contrary to the national guidelines.},

   abstract = {When preparing data sets of amino acid or nucleotide sequences it is necessary to exclude redundant or homologous sequences in order to avoid overestimating the predictive performance of an algorithm. For some time methods for doing this have been available in the area of protein structure prediction. We have developed a similar procedure based on pair-wise alignments for sequences with functional sites. We show how a correlation coefficient between sequence similarity and functional homology can be used to compare the efficiency of different similarity measures and choose a nonarbitrary threshold value for excluding redundant sequences. The impact of the choice of scoring matrix used in the alignments is examined. We demonstrate that the parameter determining the quality of the correlation is the relative entropy of the matrix, rather than the assumed (PAM or identity) substitution mode. Results are presented for the case of prediction of cleavage sites in signal peptides. By inspection of the false positives, several errors in the database were found. The procedure presented may be used as a general outline for finding a problem-specific similarity measure and threshold value for analysis of other functional amino acid or nucleotide sequence patterns.},

Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test--almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

This paper describes prescription patterns and assesses factors associated with co-prescription of antibiotics and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for patients presenting with fever in rural Tanzania. METHOD: From June 2009 to September 2011, a cohort event monitoring program was conducted among all patients treated at 8 selected health facilities in Ifakara and Rufiji Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). It included all patients presenting with fever and prescribed with AL. Logistic regression was used to model the predictors on the outcome variable which is co-prescription of AL and antibiotics on a single clinical visit. RESULTS: A cohort of 11,648 was recruited and followed up with 92% presenting with fever. Presumptive treatment was used in 56% of patients treated with AL. On average 2.4 (1 - 7) drugs was prescribed per encounter, indicating co-prescription of AL with other drugs. Children under five had higher odds of AL and antibiotics co-prescription (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46 - 0.85) than those aged more than five years. Patients testing negative had higher odds (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.65 - 2.97) of AL and antibiotics co-prescription. Patients receiving treatment from dispensaries had higher odds (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.84 - 2.30) of AL and antibiotics co-prescription than those served in health centres even though the deference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Regardless the fact that Malaria is declining but due to lack of laboratories and mRDT in most health facilities in the rural areas, clinicians are still treating malaria presumptively. This leads them to prescribe more drugs to treat all possibilities.},

Only a few studies have investigated the use of AMs among newly diagnosed patients with SLE. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to analyze prescription patterns of AMs in newly diagnosed SLE patients in Denmark from 2000 to 2011. METHODS: Using the Danish Prescription Register (DNPR), we conducted a nationwide cohort study including all patients with a first-time diagnosis of SLE (the Danish National Registry of Patients (NPR)). We used Kaplan-Meier estimates to compute the cumulative probability of starting AM treatment within a year and Cox regression analysis to compare time to treatment between patient groups. RESULTS: AMs were prescribed to 37.7% of the newly diagnosed SLE patients within the first year of follow-up. Approximately 20% did not receive any medical treatment. Women were more likely than men to start AM (adjusted HR of 1.28 (95% CI 1.08-1.52)). Patients diagnosed with SLE between 2005 and 2011 were more likely to start treatment than patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2004 (HR of 1.21 (95% CI 1.07-1.36)). Patients with renal disease were less likely to start AM treatment than patients without this condition (adjusted HR of 0.50 (95% CI 0.36-0.68)). Current users of corticosteroids were more likely to start AM treatment than non-users (adjusted HR 1.81 (95% CI 1.59-2.06)). CONCLUSION: Time to start of AM treatment following SLE diagnosis could be further reduced, especially among patients with renal disease. However, our results showed that treatment practice in recent years has changed toward initiating AM treatment earlier.},

   abstract = {During the last 10 years, an increasing number of genes have been identified whose abnormalities account for primary immunodeficiencies, with defects in development and/or function of the immune system. Among them is the JAK3-gene, encoding for a tyrosine kinase that is functionally coupled to cytokine receptors which share the common gamma chain. Defects of this gene cause an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency with almost absent T-cells and functionally defective B-cells (T(-)B(+) SCID). Herewith, we present molecular information on the first 27 unique mutations identified in the JAK3 gene, including clinical data on all of the 23 affected patients reported so far. A variety of mutations scattered throughout all seven functional domains of the protein, and with different functional effects, have been identified. Availability of a molecular screening test, based on amplification of genomic DNA, facilitates the diagnostic approach, and has permitted recognition that JAK3 deficiency may also be associated with atypical clinical and immunological features. Development of a structural model of the JAK3 kinase domain has allowed characterization of the functional effects of the various mutations. Most importantly, molecular analysis at the JAK3 locus results in improved genetic counseling, allows early prenatal diagnosis, and prompts appropriate treatment (currently based on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) in affected families.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Malaria is a major public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa where it kills a child under the age of five every 30 seconds. In Cameroon, malaria accounts for 40-45% of medical consultations, 57% of hospitalization days and 40% of mortality among children below 5 years. Community knowledge and practices can enhance the fight against this disease. The aim of the study was to make a local analysis of the people's knowledge and practices relating to the choice and source of antimalarials, self-medication, malaria dosage and resistance in order to establish behavioural baseline and epidemiological determinants and their implications for malaria control. METHODS: The design was a community-based cross-sectional study in a semi-urban setting. The survey consisted of 253 volunteer participants (from among 350 contacted) from different socio-demographic backgrounds to whom structured questionnaires were administered. The respondent's consent was sought and gained and subjects who could not read or write or understand English language were communicated to in the local language. The questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers according to the schedule of the respondent. The data was analysed using SPSS. RESULTS: Antimalarials commonly cited for malaria treatment were chloroquine (26.1%) and nivaquine (14.6%) and analgesics: panadol (23%) and paracetamol (12.3%) including native drugs (6.3%). 141(55.7%) (95% confidence interval (CI): 49.6-61.8%) participants practiced self-medication of malaria. 26.1% participants knew the correct adult malarial dosage for chloroquine or nivaquine. 125(40.4%) (95% CI: 34.4-46.7%) participants got their antimalarials from health centers, 27(10.6%) from shops, 24(9.5%) from hawkers, 23(9.1%) from the open market and 16 (6.3%) from herbalists. 66 (26.1%) (95% CI: 20.7-31.5%) participants knew the correct adult dosage for chloroquine or nivaquine treatment of malaria. 85(33.6%) (95% CI: 27.8-36.6%) participants had correct knowledge of malarial resistance. Of the 85 (33.6%) participants who had correct knowledge of antimalarial drug resistance, 52(20.6%) ascribed antimalarial drug resistance to continuous fever for a long time during treatment, 15 (5.9%) to serious fever during treatment and 18 (7.1%) when chloroquine does not stop fever. 23(27.1%) participants with correct knowledge of malarial resistance were in the 31-35 age group bracket compared with other age groups (P=0.1). There was a significant difference in correct knowledge of malarial resistance and participant's profession (p=0.0). CONCLUSION: Malaria self-medication is common in Ndu but knowledge of antimalarial drug resistance is poor. Improvement in the self-treatment of malaria could be attained by providing clear information on choices of drugs for malaria treatment. Proper health information on the rational use of ant-malarial drugs must be provided in an appropriate manner to all groups of people in the society including village health workers, women associations, churches, school children, "Mngwah" opinion leaders, herbalists, health workers and chemists. Self-medication should be improved upon by giving correct information on the dosage of malaria treatment on radio, television, posters and newspapers because banning it will push many people to use it in hiding.},

In Cameroon, malaria accounts for 40-45% of medical consultations, 57% of hospitalization days and 40% of mortality among children below 5 years. Community knowledge, attitudes and practices can enhance the fight against this disease. OBJECTIVE: To make a local analysis of the malaria problem and to establish epidemiological and behavioural baseline data and their implications for malaria control. METHODS: The study design was an observational community-based cross-sectional study in a semi-urban setting. Two hundred and fifty three participants of different socio-demographic status took part in the study from among 350 contacted. A structured questionnaire was administered to volunteers. The respondent's consent was sought and gained and subjects who could not read or write or understand English language were communicated to in the local language. The questionnaire was administered by a trained interviewer according to the schedule of the respondent. The data was analysed using SPSS. RESULTS: Antimalarials commonly cited for malaria treatment were chloroquine (26.09%) and nivaquine (14.62%) and analgesics: panadol (22.92%) and paracetamol (12.25%) including native drugs (6.32%). One hundred and forty-one (55.7%) [95% confidence interval (CI): 49.58-61.82%)] participants practiced self-treatment of malaria. Only 26.09% participants knew the correct adult malarial dosage for chloroquine and/or nivaquine. One hundred and twenty five (40.41%) [95% CI: 34.36-46.46%] participants got their antimalarials from authorized sources. One hundred and twenty five (40.41%) participants indicated that they get their antimalarials from the health center, 27(10.61%) from the shop, 24(9.49%) from hawkers, 23(9.09%) from the open market and 16 (6.3%) from herbalists. Only 66 (26.09%) [95% CI: 20.67-31.50%] participants knew the correct adult dosage for chloroquine or nivaquine treatment of malaria. Eighty five (33.6%) [95% CI: 27.78-36.57%] participants had correct knowledge of malarial resistance. Of the 85 (33.6%) participants who had knowledge of malaria resistance, 52(20.55%) ascribed malaria resistance to continuous fever for a long time during treatment, 15 (5.93%) to serious fever during treatment and 18 (7.12%) when chloroquine does not stop the malarial fever. Most (27.06%) of those who had the correct knowledge of malarial resistance were in the age group 31-35 bracket compared with other age groups (P>0.05). There was no difference in correct knowledge of malarial resistance and participant's professions. CONCLUSION: Malaria self-treatment is common but knowledge of malaria resistance is poor. This method should be improved upon by giving correct information on the dosage of adult malaria treatment on radio, television, posters and newspapers because banning it will push many people to use it in hiding since it has its advantages. Malaria drug abuse can lead to drug resistance hence in-vitro and in-vivo tests are warranted to confirm malaria resistance.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexa are known to contain greatly reduced organellar genomes. Their mitochondrial genome carries only three protein-coding genes, and their plastid genome is reduced to a 35-kb-long circle. The discovery of coral-endosymbiotic algae Chromera velia and Vitrella brassicaformis, which share a common ancestry with Apicomplexa, provided an opportunity to study possibly ancestral forms of organellar genomes, a unique glimpse into the evolutionary history of apicomplexan parasites. The structurally similar mitochondrial genomes of Chromera and Vitrella differ in gene content, which is reflected in the composition of their respiratory chains. Thus, Chromera lacks respiratory complexes I and III, whereas Vitrella and apicomplexan parasites are missing only complex I. Plastid genomes differ substantially between these algae, particularly in structure: The Chromera plastid genome is a linear, 120-kb molecule with large and divergent genes, whereas the plastid genome of Vitrella is a highly compact circle that is only 85 kb long but nonetheless contains more genes than that of Chromera. It appears that organellar genomes have already been reduced in free-living phototrophic ancestors of apicomplexan parasites, and such reduction is not associated with parasitism.},

   abstract = {The antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases for more than 60 years. Even today new indications evolve due to the complex mode of action of these compounds. Due to the fear of side effects, especially irreversible retinopathy, their use is often limited. These side-effects, however, are a consequence of excessive daily dosages. An effective, safe therapy needs correct dosing, i. e. adherence to maximal daily dosages of 3.5(-4) mg chloroquine or 6(-6.5) mg hydroxychloroquine per kilogram ideal body weight. If the actual body weight is lower than the ideal body weight, this actual weight is used for the calculation of the dosage. Observing these limits allows a rather safe therapy of the diseases like lupus erythematosus, REM syndrome, porphyria cutanea tarda (2 x 125 mg chloroquine/week), cutaneous sarcoidosis and dermatomyositis. If standard therapies fail, then antimalarials can be tried to treat Sjogren syndrome, granuloma annulare or erosive lichen planus. If therapy fails, either can be combined with quinacrine to increase their effectiveness. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are indispensable and well-tolerated essential drugs in dermatology and especially suited as part of a combination scheme, for example with corticosteroids, as they act synergistically and reduce side-effects.},

A structured questionnaire was used in a cross-sectional survey. Knowledge on malaria was asked of 357 key household respondents. The proportions of use of traditional medicine, modern medicine and both among febrile subjects were 31 (7.0%), 247 (55.4%) and 168 (37.7%), respectively. A blood test was taken by 41.0% of respondents and, of these, 81.4% were reported positive. Among 166 artesunate users, 45.8% reported positive test results and 18.1% were self-medicated. Only 37 (10.4%) key household respondents did not have misconceptions on malaria transmission. Predictors for having a blood test were being male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96; 95% CI 1.20-3.22), having a higher knowledge on malaria (OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.03-3.06) and aged 50 years or above (OR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.13-0.78).

   abstract = {Multi-drug resistance to the available antimalarial drugs is a major threat for malaria treatment. Due to the recent characterization of human and parasite genome sequences, both ligand and target based drug design strategies may be helpful for the design of potential antimalarial compounds with reduced degree of resistance. The present work deals with quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, pharmacophore mapping and docking studies of a series of 95 nucleoside analogs as inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (PfdUTPase), an enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism that acts as a first line of defence against uracil incorporation into DNA. The QSAR and pharmacophore models were validated both internally and externally showing good statistical results. The docking study was performed and validated using three different software tools namely Discovery Studio 2.1 (Accelrys), Maestro 9.3 (Schrodinger) and MOE (Chemical Computing Group). The QSAR studies revealed that compounds containing substituted aromatic carbons (aasC fragment) and those bearing hydroxyl groups without an noxolane ring exert potent PfdUTPase inhibitory activity. The best pharmacophore hypothesis (hypothesis 1) possessed four features: (i) one hydrogen bond donor (HBD), (ii) one hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), (iii) one hydrophobic (HYD) and (iv) one ring aromatic (RA). The docking studies revealed that the PfdUTPase inhibitors interact with a pocket containing Phe46, Lys48, Leu88, Asn103, Gly106, Leu107, Ile108, Tyr112, Ile116, Ile117, Ala118 and Ala119 amino acid residues. The interaction pattern of all the PfdUTPase inhibitors was almost same in case of docking using Discovery Studio 2.1, Maestro 9.3 and MOE software. This work thus presents the first QSAR report for nucleoside analogs which may serve as an efficient tool to address the increasing threat of malaria in the developing countries.},

   abstract = {Due to the emergence of multidrug resistance of malaria parasites, there is an urgent need to modify existing antimalarial drugs through structural changes as well as to search new pharmacophores to counteract the induced resistance. In the present work, different quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models have been developed using a series of 73 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridin-9(10H)-one (THA) analogs with well defined antimalarial activity against W2 clone to provide detailed insight into the main structural fragments that impart antimalarial activity to these molecules. To the best of our knowledge, this is first QSAR report of THA analogs as antimalarials. From the developed models, it may be inferred that for an enhancement in the antimalarial activity of the molecules: i) R2 position should be substituted with a bulky group (like phenyl, methoxy, isopropyl, tertiary butyl group) which may be further substituted with electrostatically favored positively charged group; ii) R3 position should be substituted with hydrophobically favored but sterically disfavored group; iii) R4 position should be substituted with positively charged group lacking any carbon atom and iv) R5 position should be substituted with two methyl groups. On the contrary, substitution with bulky group at R6 position may reduce the antimalarial activity. Using the developed models, we have designed and proposed some new compounds which showed good in silico predicted activity. The designed compounds may be experimentally proved to be active and useful THA derivatives as antimalarial compounds.},

Tec family protein tyrosine kinases contain a PH domain. In Btk, also PH domain mutations lead into an immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). A new disease-causing mutation was identified in the PH domain. The structures for the PH domains of Bmx, Itk, and Tec were modelled based on Btk structure. The domains seem to have similar scaffolding and electrostatic polarisation but to have some differences in the binding regions.

The peptide for the N-terminal half of the PRR binds specifically, whereas the other peptide had hardly any affinity. The TH domain has about four times lower affinity to the SH3 domain than the peptide, 17.0 vs 3.9 microM. The interaction was further tested with an SH3 domain construct that contained the PRR. The two peptides cannot compete for the binding to the extended protein and the TH domain has two times lower affinity to the extended SH3 domain. The intra- or intermolecular interaction between the TH and SH3 domain might have regulatory function also in the other Tec family members.},

   abstract = {Resistance to the amino alcohol quinine has been associated with polymorphisms in pfnhe, a sodium hydrogen exchanger. We investigated the role of this gene in quinine resistance in vitro in isolates from Kenya. We analyzed pfnhe whole-gene polymorphisms, using capillary sequencing, and pfcrt at codon 76 (pfcrt-76) and pfmdr1 at codon 86 (pfmdr1-86), using PCR-enzyme restriction methodology, in 29 isolates from Kilifi, Kenya, for association with the in vitro activities of quinine and 2 amino alcohols, mefloquine and halofantrine. In vitro activity was assessed as the drug concentration that inhibits 50% of parasite growth (IC50). The median IC50s of quinine, halofantrine, and mefloquine were 92, 22, and 18 nM, respectively. The presence of 2 DNNND repeats in microsatellite ms4760 of pfnhe was associated with reduced susceptibility to quinine (60 versus 227 nM for 1 and 2 repeats, respectively; P<0.05), while 3 repeats were associated with restoration of susceptibility. The decrease in susceptibility conferred by the 2 DNNND repeats was more pronounced in parasites harboring the pfmdr1-86 mutation. No association was found between susceptibility to quinine and the pfcrt-76 mutation or between susceptibility to mefloquine or halofantrine and the pfnhe gene and the pfcrt-76 and pfmdr1-86 mutations. Using previously published data on the in vitro activities of chloroquine, lumefantrine, piperaquine, and dihydroartemisinin, we investigated the association of their activities with pfnhe polymorphism. With the exception of a modulation of the activity of lumefantrine by a mutation at position 1437, pfnhe did not modulate their activities. Two DNNND repeats combined with the pfmdr1-86 mutation could be used as an indicator of reduced susceptibility to quinine.},

Our previous work demonstrated that hybrid compounds, comprising endoperoxides and vinyl sulfones, were capable of high activity profiles comparable to artemisinin and chloroquine while acting through two distinct mechanisms of action: oxidative stress and falcipain inhibition. In this study, we adapted this approach to a novel class of falcipain inhibitors: peptidomimetic pyrimidine nitriles. Pyrimidine tetraoxane hybrids displayed potent nanomolar activity against three strains of Plasmodium falciparum and falcipain-2, combined with low cytotoxicity. In vivo, a decrease in parasitemia and an increase in survival of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei was observed when compared to control. All tested compounds combined good blood stage activity with significant effects on liver stage parasitemia, a most welcome feature for any new class of antimalarial drug.},

   abstract = {There are currently less than 40 locus-specific databases (LSDBs) and one large general database that curate data on somatic mutations in human cancer genes. These databases have different scope and use different annotation standards and database systems, resulting in duplicated efforts in data curation, and making it difficult for users to find clear and consistent information. As data related to somatic mutations are generated at an increasing pace it is urgent to create a framework for improving the collecting of this information and making it more accessible to clinicians, scientists, and epidemiologists to facilitate research on biomarkers. Here we propose a data flow for improving the connectivity between existing databases and we provide practical guidelines for data reporting, database contents, and annotation standards. These proposals are based on common standards recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) with additions related to specific requirements of somatic mutations in cancer. Indeed, somatic mutations may be used in molecular pathology and clinical studies to characterize tumor types, help treatment choice, predict response to treatment and patient outcome, or in epidemiological studies as markers for tumor etiology or exposure assessment. Thus, specific annotations are required to cover these diverse research topics. This initiative is meant to promote collaboration and discussion on these issues and the development of adequate resources that would avoid the loss of extremely valuable information generated by years of basic and clinical research.},

   abstract = {B cells are an important component of adaptive immunity. They produce and secrete millions of different antibody molecules, each of which recognizes a different (foreign) antigen. The fact that humans express a very large repertoire of antibodies is due to the complex mechanism of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes as well as other processes including somatic hypermutation, gene conversion and class switching. The B cell receptor (BCR) is an integral membrane protein complex that is composed of two Ig heavy chains, two Ig light chains and two heterodimers of Igalpha and Igbeta. To eliminate foreign antigens, B cells cooperate with other cells of the immune system including macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells. B cell development is a tightly controlled process in which over 75% of the developing cells become apoptotic because of inappropriate immunoglobulin gene rearrangements or recognition of self antigens by Igs. Hence, the majority of B cell-associated disorders are caused by the incorrect function of genes/proteins involved in B cell development.},

The majority of B-cells enter apoptosis, while some of them progress through the cell cycle and become, for example, antibody producing plasma cells. We studied BCR stimulated Ramos B-cells to explore the expression of BCR pathway, cell cycle and apoptosis related genes.

   abstract = {Parasites from the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for several major diseases of man, including malaria and toxoplasmosis. These highly motile protozoa use a conserved actomyosin-based mode of movement to power tissue traversal and host cell invasion. The mode termed as 'gliding motility' relies on the dynamic turnover of actin, whose polymerisation state is controlled by a markedly limited number of identifiable regulators when compared with other eukaryotic cells. Recent studies of apicomplexan actin regulator structure-in particular those of the core triad of monomer-binding proteins, actin-depolymerising factor/cofilin, cyclase-associated protein/Srv2, and profilin-have provided new insights into possible mechanisms of actin regulation in parasite cells, highlighting divergent structural features and functions to regulators from other cellular systems. Furthermore, the unusual nature of apicomplexan actin itself is increasingly coming into the spotlight. Here, we review recent advances in understanding of the structure and function of actin and its regulators in apicomplexan parasites. In particular we explore the paradox between there being an abundance of unpolymerised actin, its having a seemingly increased potential to form filaments relative to vertebrate actin, and the apparent lack of visible, stable filaments in parasite cells.},

   abstract = {A new protein, termed apicortin, has been identified, which contains a DCX (doublecortin) and a partial p25-alpha domain. The DCX domains of the doublecortin superfamily are responsible for their microtubule binding and stabilizing properties. The p25-alpha domain occurs in TPPPs (Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Proteins) exhibiting Microtubule Associated Protein (MAP)-like functions. TPPP orthologs can be classified as long- and short-type ones. The latter ones do not contain the partial p25-alpha domain, which is the most conservative part of the long-type TPPPs and was evolutionary-preserved independently from the whole domain. Apicortin seems to occur only in the placozoan animal Trichoplax adhaerens and in each of the apicomplexan parasites, the genomes of which are available. The function of the novel protein can be predicted from the fact that it contains two different microtubule-binding domains. Apicomplexans, important pathogens of humans and animals, possess unique cytoskeletal elements, as subpellicular microtubules and apical polar rings, which are specific for this phylum, extremely stabilized by unknown MAPs. One of the candidates can be the apicortin, which is supported by a recent experimental proteomics analysis. The role of the new protein in T. adhaerens may be similar but needs clarification.},

   abstract = {It is generally considered mammals and birds have five Tec family kinases (TFKs): Btk, Bmx (also known as Etk), Itk, Tec, and Txk (also known as Rlk). Here, we discuss the domains and their functions and regulation in TFKs. Over the last few years, a large number of genomes from various phyla have been sequenced making it possible to study evolutionary relationships at the molecular and sequence level. Using bioinformatics tools, we for the first time demonstrate that a TFK ancestor exists in the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, which is the closest known relative to metazoans with a sequenced genome. The analysis of the genomes for sponges, insects, hagfish, and frogs suggests that these species encode a single TFK. The insect form has a divergent and unique N-terminal region. Duplications generating the five members took place prior to the emergence of vertebrates. Fishes have two or three forms and the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, has four (lacks Txk). Thus, not all mammals have all five TFKs. The single identified TFK in frogs is an ortholog of Tec. Bmx seems to be unique to mammals and birds. SH3BP5 is a negative regulator of Btk. It is conserved in choanoflagellates and interestingly exists also in nematodes, which do not express TFKs, suggesting a broader function in addition to Btk regulation. The related SH3BP5-like protein is not found in Nematodes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The immune system, which is a complex machinery, is based on the highly coordinated expression of a wide array of genes and proteins. The evolutionary history of the human immune system is not well characterised. Although several studies related to the development and evolution of immunological processes have been published, a full-scale genome-based analysis is still missing. A database focused on the evolutionary relationships of immune related genes would contribute to and facilitate research on immunology and evolutionary biology. RESULTS: An Internet resource called ImmTree http://bioinf.uta.fi/ImmTree was constructed for studying the evolution and evolutionary trees of the human immune system. ImmTree contains information about orthologs in 80 species collected from the HomoloGene, OrthoMCL and EGO databases. In addition to phylogenetic trees, the service provides data for the comparison of human-mouse ortholog pairs, including synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates, Z values, and Ka/Ks quotients. A versatile search engine allows complex queries from the database. Currently, data is available for 847 human immune system related genes and proteins. CONCLUSION: ImmTree provides a unique data set of genes and proteins from the human immune system, their phylogenetics, and information for comparisons of human-mouse ortholog pairs, synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates, as well as other statistical information.},

We identified numerous pseudogenes, many of which are expressed, and found two putative new genes.

A list of genes and proteins were compiled. A comprehensive characterization of the member genes and proteins, including the corresponding pseudogenes is presented.

A recent definition of a reference set of proteins essential for the human immunome, combined with information about protein interaction networks for these proteins, facilitates evolutionary study of this biological machinery. RESULTS: Here, we present a detailed study of the development of the immunome protein interaction network during eight evolutionary steps from Bilateria ancestors to human. New nodes show preferential attachment to high degree proteins. The efficiency of the immunome protein interaction network increases during the evolutionary steps, whereas the vulnerability of the network decreases. CONCLUSION: Our results shed light on selective forces acting on the emergence of biological networks. It is likely that the high efficiency and low vulnerability are intrinsic properties of many biological networks, which arise from the effects of evolutionary processes yet to be uncovered.},

DESCRIPTION: The service can detect pseudogenes, that have arisen either by retrotransposition or segmental genome duplication, many of which are not listed in the public pseudogene databases. The service has a user-friendly web interface and uses a powerful computer cluster in order to perform parallel searches and provide relatively fast runtimes despite exhaustive database searches and analyses. CONCLUSION: PseudoGeneQuest is a versatile tool for detecting novel pseudogene candidates from the human genome. The service searches human genome sequences for five types of pseudogenes and provides an output that allows easy further analysis of observations.

With the emergence of high-throughput technologies, a great amount of molecular data is available for the genes and proteins of the immune system. However, these data are scattered into several databases and literature and therefore integration is needed. DESCRIPTION: The Immunome Knowledge Base (IKB) is a dedicated resource for immunological information. We identified and collected genes that are essential for the immunome. Nucleotide and protein sequences, as well as information about the related pseudogenes are available for 893 human essential immunome genes. To allow the study of the evolution of the immune system, data for the orthologs of human genes was collected. In addition to the human immunome, ortholog groups of 1811 metazoan immunity genes are available with information about the evidence of their immunity function. IKB combines three previous databases and several additional data items in an integrated system. CONCLUSION: IKB provides in one single service access to several databases and resources and contains plenty of new data about immune system. The most recent addition is variation data on genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels for all the immunome genes and proteins. In the future, more data will be added on the function of these genes. The service has a free and public web interface.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of pre-season treatment with single dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) on subsequent malaria morbidity in under-fives. METHODS: A cohort of 156 children was enrolled for longitudinal follow-up. Children received curative therapy with SP or AL, and a third group received no treatment. Participants were home-visited twice a week with blood smears taken from children with fever (axillary T degrees >/= 37.5 degrees C) or history of fever. To assess the time to re-infection, a blood film was also systematically obtained from pre-treated children every 2 weeks. RESULTS: The mean time to the first malaria infection was 36 days in the SP arm and 26 days in the AL arm (P=0.006). The incidence density of malaria infection was similar in both groups (86.5%vs. 92.3%, P=0.52). The mean time to the first malaria episode was 47 days in the SP arm and 32 days in the AL arm (P<0.001). The incidence of malaria episodes was significantly higher in the group pre-treated with AL (45.7 per 1000 child days-at-risk CI 95% [35-56]) than in the control group (10.7 per 1000 child days-at-risk CI 95% [7-15]); P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the radical clearance of parasitemia with AL may increase susceptibility to malaria infection and clinical malaria episodes.},

Free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) can be used for IEF to separate proteins within a pH gradient according to their pIs. In an FFE system, this separation is performed entirely in the liquid phase, without the need for particulate chromatographic media, gels, or membranes. Herein, we demonstrated the compatibility of IEF-FFE with ESI-Fourier transform ICR MS (ESI-FTICR-MS) for top-down experiments. We demonstrated that IEF-FFE of intact proteins were highly reproducible between FFE instruments, between laboratories, and between analyses. Applying native (0.2% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) IEF-FFE to an enzyme resulted in no decrease in enzyme activity; applying either native or denaturing (8 M urea) IEF-FFE to a four-protein mixture with different pIs resulted in isolation of each protein into separate fractions in a 96-well plate. After desalting, each protein was sequenced by top-down MS/MS. As an application of this technique, chicken erythrocyte histone H2A-IV and its major modified forms were enriched by IEF-FFE. Top-down analysis revealed Lys-5 to be a major acetylation site, in addition to N-terminal acetylation.},

   abstract = {The private for-profit sector is an important source of treatment for malaria. However, private patients face high prices for the recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which makes them more likely to receive cheaper, less effective non-artemisinin therapies (nATs). This study seeks to better understand consumer antimalarial prices by documenting and exploring the pricing behaviour of retailers and wholesalers. Using data collected in 2009-10, we present survey estimates of antimalarial retail prices, and wholesale- and retail-level price mark-ups from six countries (Benin, Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia), along with qualitative findings on factors affecting pricing decisions. Retail prices were lowest for nATs, followed by ACTs and artemisinin monotherapies (AMTs). Retailers applied the highest percentage mark-ups on nATs (range: 40% in Nigeria to 100% in Cambodia and Zambia), whereas mark-ups on ACTs (range: 22% in Nigeria to 71% in Zambia) and AMTs (range: 22% in Nigeria to 50% in Uganda) were similar in magnitude, but lower than those applied to nATs. Wholesale mark-ups were generally lower than those at retail level, and were similar across antimalarial categories in most countries. When setting prices wholesalers and retailers commonly considered supplier prices, prevailing market prices, product availability, product characteristics and the costs related to transporting goods, staff salaries and maintaining a property. Price discounts were regularly used to encourage sales and were sometimes used by wholesalers to reward long-term customers. Pricing constraints existed only in Benin where wholesaler and retailer mark-ups are regulated; however, unlicensed drug vendors based in open-air markets did not adhere to the pricing regime. These findings indicate that mark-ups on antimalarials are reasonable. Therefore, improving ACT affordability would be most readily achieved by interventions that reduce commodity prices for retailers, such as ACT subsidies, pooled purchasing mechanisms and cost-effective strategies to increase the distribution coverage area of wholesalers.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency of retinal toxicity and associated risk factors in a cohort of patients treated with antimalarials and seen at a tertiary level hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 40 patients treated with antimalarials, who were referred to ophthalmology for the study of retinal toxicity during 2011. Data collection included type of antimalarial prescribed, daily and cumulative doses, presence of rheumatic disease, corticosteroid use, associated diseases and ophthalmologic examination. Retinal toxicity was confirmed if two of the following tests were altered: fundus examination, visual field with a macular pattern, changes in spectral domain optical coherence tomography and full-field electroretinography. RESULTS: Toxic retinopathy was detected in 13.1% of patients (95% confidence interval 5-21%) and a trend for a higher risk was observed in case of chloroquine (CQ) treatment. Among the patients with retinopathy, the mean cumulative dose was 229 g for CQ and 111 g for Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the mean daily dose of CQ was 250 mg and 333 mg for HCQ. Arterial hypertension had a statistically significant effect on retinopathy development. CONCLUSIONS: Toxic retinopathy defined by ophthalmological evaluation was detected in 13.1% of patients. A trend for a higher risk was observed in case of chloroquine treatment.},

   abstract = {We report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding the mitochondrial short chain delta 3, delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase from rat liver. Tryptic fragments of the purified protein were generated, purified, and sequenced. A rat liver cDNA library, constructed in the plasmid vector pUEX1 was screened with oligonucleotides synthesized on the basis of peptide sequences. The obtained clone contained 783 bases predicting to code the entire mature protein of 261 amino acids. The molecular weight of 29,300 predicted from cDNA-derived sequences was consistent with the subunit size determined earlier. A high degree of similarity was noted between the amino acid sequence of isomerase and that of the amino-terminal half of peroxisomal multifunctional isomerase-hydratase-dehydrogenase enzyme and mitochondrial 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase in rat liver. These similarities also appeared at the level of predicted secondary structural elements, suggesting that hte rat multifunctional enzyme has both the isomerization and hydration activities in the amino-terminal domain. This idea is further supported by the proposed existence of only one CoA-binding site in the amino-terminal half of the multifunctional enzyme and by previous studies suggesting that the transfer of the substrate from the isomerization site to the hydration site occurs without aqueous bulk phase (Palosaari P.M., and Hiltunen, J.

   abstract = {The export of proteins to the periplasmic compartment of bacterial cells is mediated by an amino-terminal signal peptide. After transport, the signal peptide is cleaved by a processing enzyme, signal peptidase I. A comparison of the cleavage sites of many exported proteins has identified a conserved feature of small, uncharged amino acids at positions -1 and -3 relative to the cleavage site. To determine experimentally the sequences required for efficient signal peptide cleavage, we simultaneously randomized the amino acid residues from positions -4 to +2 of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase enzyme to form a library of random sequences. Mutants that provide wild-type levels of ampicillin resistance were then selected from the random-sequence library. The sequences of 15 mutants indicated a bias towards small amino acids. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme was determined for nine of the mutants to assign the new -1 and -3 residues. Alanine was present in the -1 position for all nine of these mutants, strongly supporting the importance of alanine at the -1 position. The amino acids at the -3 position were much less conserved but were consistent with the -3 rules derived from sequence comparisons. Compared with the wild type, two of the nine mutants have an altered cleavage position, suggesting that sequence is more important than position for processing of the signal peptide.},

   abstract = {Rotavirus infection has been proposed to enhance progression towards type 1 diabetes in at-risk children. Rhesus monkey rotavirus (RRV) accelerates diabetes onset in non-obese diabetic (NOD) and T cell receptor transgenic NOD8.3 mice. Infected NOD mice show virus spread to pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), induction of a serum T helper 1-biased specific antibody response and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in PLN and islets. Here, we analysed the effects of RRV infection on intestinal responses and the activation of antigen presenting cells (APC), T cells and B cells in PLN, MLN, spleen and islets. Diabetes acceleration by RRV was associated with minimal immune activation in Peyer's patches. Increased proinflammatory cytokine expression by APC, including dendritic cells, was observed exclusively in the PLN, while cytokine expression by T cells was detected in islets, PLN, MLN and spleen. RRV infection of NOD8.3 mice increased IFNgamma expression by CD8(+) T cells, which primarily recognise an islet autoantigen. A peptide corresponding to RRV VP7 amino acids 5-13, with sequence similarity to this islet autoantigen, did not induce activation or proliferation of NOD8.3 mouse T cells. RRV infection of NOD mice elevated B cell MHC I expression in PLN and MLN, and increased the B cell-mediated proliferation of islet antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. These studies demonstrate that RRV infection of NOD mice activates APC, T cells and B cells at sites where autoreactive lymphocytes accumulate, in association with proinflammatory cytokine expression and an increased capacity to present antigen. Taken together with previous findings, these data support a possible role for bystander activation in type 1 diabetes acceleration by RRV.},

Transgenic corn lines containing recombinant green fluorescence protein (r-GFP) and a recombinant subunit vaccine of Escherichia coli enterotoxin (r-LTB), primarily expressed in endosperm, and another two corn lines containing recombinant human collagen (r-CIalpha1) and r-GFP, primarily expressed in germ, were used as model systems. The kernels were either ground and used for fermentation or dry fractionated to recover germ-rich fractions prior to grinding for fermentation. The finished beers of whole ground kernels and r-protein-spent endosperm solids contained 127-139 and 138-155 g/L ethanol concentrations, respectively. The ethanol levels did not differ among transgenic and normal corn feedstocks, indicating the residual r-proteins did not negatively affect ethanol production. r-Protein extraction and germ removal also did not negatively affect fermentation of the remaining mass. Most r-proteins were inactivated during the mashing process used to prepare corn for fermentation. No functionally active r-GFP or r-LTB proteins were found after fermentation of the r-protein-spent solids; however, a small quantity of residual r-CIalpha1 was detected in DDGS, indicating that the safety of DDGS produced from transgenic grain for r-protein production needs to be evaluated for each event. Protease treatment during fermentation completely hydrolyzed the residual r-CIalpha1, and no residual r-proteins were detectable in DDGS.},

In addition to the negative feedback regulation of p38-p53 signaling, PPM1D inhibits other tumor suppressor activities and is involved in the control of DNA damage and repair pathways. To elucidate the functional significance of PPM1D in breast cancer, we employed RNA interference to downregulate PPM1D expression in BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines and then investigated the effects of PPM1D silencing on global gene expression patterns and signaling pathways using oligonucleotide microarrays. We identified 1798 differentially expressed (at least a two-fold change) gene elements with functions related to key cellular processes, such as regulation of cell cycle, assembly of various intracellular structures and components, and regulation of signaling pathways and metabolic cascades. For instance, genes involved in apoptosis (NR4A1, RAB25, PLK1), formation of nucleosome structure (HIST1H2AC, HIST1H2BF, HIST1H2BO, HIST1H1D), and hormone related activities (NR4A1, ESR1, STC1) were among the differentially expressed genes. Overall, our findings suggest that PPM1D contributes to breast cancer associated phenotypic characteristics by directly or indirectly affecting several important cellular signaling pathways.},

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are receiving increasing attention as anticancer therapy. It has revolutionarised the management of CML to say the least. TKIs are also increasingly being implicated in complicated but vital life cycle of malaria parasite. Hence we tested two commonly used but different classes of TKIs (imatinib and sorafenib) in-vitro for their antimalarial activity and possible synergistic activity with existing antimalarial drug. Antimalarial activity was tested with the help of modified WHO microtest technique in-vitro for five different Plasmodium falciparum laboratory strains (3D7, Dd2, 7G8, MRC2, PKL9). Imatinib and sorafenib showed a promising antimalarial activity with all the strains. These compounds caused dose dependent inhibition of parasite maturation. The isobologram analysis of the interactions of these TKIs with standard antimalarial drug, artesunate revealed distinct patterns of synergism, additivity and antagonism at different ratios. Imatinib showed worthwhile synergism with artesunate indicating imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors may have significant antimalarial activity and can be used in combination therapy.},

   abstract = {Signal peptides are a cornerstone mechanism for cellular protein localization, yet until now experimental determination of signal peptides has come from only a narrow taxonomic sampling. As a result, the dominant view is that Sec-cleaved signal peptides in prokaryotes are defined by a canonical AxA motif. Although other residues are permitted in the motif, alanine is by far the most common. Here we broadly examine proteomics data to reveal the signal peptide sequences for 32 bacterial and archaeal organisms from nine phyla and demonstrate that this alanine preference is not universal. Discoveries include fundamentally distinct signal peptide motifs from Alphaproteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Thermotogae and Euryarchaeota. In these novel motifs, alanine is no longer the dominant residue but has been replaced in a different way for each taxon. Surprisingly, divergent motifs correlate with a proteome-wide reduction in alanine. Computational analyses of ~1,500 genomes reveal numerous major evolutionary clades which have replaced the canonical signal peptide sequence with novel motifs. IMPORTANCE: This article replaces a widely held general model with a more detailed model describing phylogenetically correlated variation in motifs for Sec secretion.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexans are a diverse group of obligate parasites occupying different intracellular niches that require modification to meet the needs of the parasite. To efficiently manipulate their environment, apicomplexans translocate numerous parasite proteins into the host cell. Whereas some parasites remain contained within a parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) throughout their developmental cycle, others do not, a difference that affects the machinery needed for protein export. A signal-mediated pathway for protein export into the host cell has been characterized in Plasmodium parasites, which maintain the PVM. Here, we functionally demonstrate an analogous host-targeting pathway involving organellar staging prior to secretion in the related bovine parasite, Babesia bovis, a parasite that destroys the PVM shortly after invasion. Taking into account recent identification of a similar signal-mediated pathway in the coccidian parasite Toxoplasma gondii, we suggest a model in which this conserved pathway has evolved in multiple steps from signal-mediated trafficking to specific secretory organelles for controlled secretion to a complex protein translocation process across the PVM.},

   abstract = {A series of cinnamic acid/4-aminoquinoline conjugates conceived to link, through a proper retro-enantio dipeptide, a heterocyclic core known to prevent hemozoin formation, to a trans-cinnamic acid motif capable of inhibiting enzyme catalytic Cys residues, were synthesized as potential dual-action antimalarials. The effect of amino acid configuration and the absence of the dipeptide spacer were also assessed. The replacement of the D-amino acids by their natural L counterparts led to a decrease in both anti-plasmodial and falcipain-inhibitory activity, suggesting that the former are preferable. Molecules with such spacer were active against blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum, in vitro, and hemozoin formation, implying that the dipeptide has a key role in mediating these two activities. In turn, compounds without spacer were better falcipain-2 inhibitors, likely because these compounds are smaller and have their vinyl bonds in closer vicinity to the catalytic Cys, as suggested by molecular modeling calculations. These novel conjugates constitute promising leads for the development of new antiplasmodials targeted at blood-stage malaria parasites.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many proteins with vastly dissimilar sequences are found to share a common fold, as evidenced in the wealth of structures now available in the Protein Data Bank. One idea that has found success in various applications is the concept of a reduced amino acid alphabet, wherein similar amino acids are clustered together. Given the structural similarity exhibited by many apparently dissimilar sequences, we undertook this study looking for improvements in fold recognition by comparing protein sequences written in a reduced alphabet. RESULTS: We tested over 150 of the amino acid clustering schemes proposed in the literature with all-versus-all pairwise sequence alignments of sequences in the Distance mAtrix aLIgnment database. We combined several metrics from information retrieval popular in the literature: mean precision, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and recall at a fixed error rate and found that, in contrast to previous work, reduced alphabets in many cases outperform full alphabets. We find that reduced alphabets can perform at a level comparable to full alphabets in correct pairwise alignment of sequences and can show increased sensitivity to pairs of sequences with structural similarity but low-sequence identity. Based on these results, we hypothesize that reduced alphabets may also show performance gains with more sophisticated methods such as profile and pattern searches.

   abstract = {Primary immunodeficiencies (IDs) are a heterogenic group of inherited disorders of the immune system. Immunodeficiency patients have increased susceptibility to recurrent and persistent, even life-threatening infections. Mutations in a large number of genes can cause defects in different cellular functions and lead to impaired immune response. To date, approximately 150 IDs and more than 100 affected genes have been identified. ID-related genes are distributed throughout the genome, and diseases can be inherited in an X-linked, an autosomal recessive, or an autosomal dominant way. We have collected ID mutation data into locus-specific patient-related mutation databases, IDbases (http://bioinf.uta.fi/IDbases). Mutations are described at DNA, mRNA, and protein levels with links to reference sequences and reference articles. The mutation data has been collated into entries along with some clinical information. IDbases offer an easy way, e.g., to find recently identified mutations, to reveal genotype-phenotype correlations, and to discover a specific mutation or to examine the most common mutations in a single immunodeficiency related gene. At the moment we have databases for 107 ID genes with 4,140 public patient entries. An exhaustive statistical analysis of mutation data from the IDbases was made. Missense and nonsense mutations are the most common mutation types, and the most common single substitution is a nonsense mutation from tryptophan to a stop codon. Arginine is the most mutated as well as the most abundant mutant amino acid.},

Twenty-five anti-PSA monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were studied for binding to a large array of synthetic linear peptides selected from computer models of PSA and hK2, as well as to biotinylated peptides covering the entire PSA sequence. Sixteen of the Mabs were bound to linear peptides forming four independent binding regions (I-IV). Binding region I was localized to amino acid residues 1-13 (identical sequence for PSA and hK2), II (a and b) was localized to residues 53-64, III (a and b) was localized to residues 80-91 (= kallikrein loop), and IV was localized to residues 151-164. Mabs binding to regions I and IIa were reactive with free PSA, PSA-ACT complex, and with hK2; Mabs binding to regions IIb, IIIa, and IV were reactive with free PSA and PSA-ACT complex, but unreactive with hK2; Mabs binding to region IIIb detected free PSA only. All Mabs tested (n = 7) specific for free PSA reacted with kallikrein loop (binding region IIIb). The presence of Mabs interacting with binding region I did not inhibit the catalytic activity of PSA, whereas Mabs interacting with other binding regions inhibited the catalysis. Theoretical model structures of PSA, hK2, and the PSA-ACT complex were combined with the presented data to suggest an overall orientation of PSA with regard to ACT.},

The 545 amino acid protein encoded by AIRE contains several structural motifs suggestive of a transcriptional regulator and bears similarity to cellular proteins involved in transcriptional control. We show here that AIRE fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain activates transcription from a reporter promoter, and the activation seen requires the full-length protein or more than one activation domain. At the structural level AIRE forms homodimers through the NH(2)-terminal domain, and molecular modeling for this domain suggests a four-helix bundle structure. In agreement, we show that the common transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) interacts with AIRE in vitro and in yeast nuclei through the CH1 and CH3 conserved domains. We suggest that the transcriptional transactivation properties of AIRE together with its interaction with CBP might be important in its function as disease-causing mutations almost totally abolish the activation effect.},

Over 40% of diapause II embryos survive 113 days of exposure to 75.5% relative humidity. An early loss of water from the perivitelline space occurs during days 1-2, but thereafter, rates of water loss are reduced to near zero. No dehydration of the embryonic tissue is indicated based on microscopic observations and the retention of bulk (freezable) water in embryos as judged by differential scanning calorimetry. Such high resistance to desiccation is unprecedented among aquatic vertebrates. Infrared spectroscopy indicates frequent intermolecular contacts via beta-sheet (14%) in hydrated egg envelopes (chorions). These beta-sheet contacts increase to 36% on dehydration of the egg envelope. Interestingly, the egg envelope is composed of protein fibrils with characteristics of amyloid fibrils usually associated with human disease. These features include a high proportion of intermolecular beta-sheet, positive staining and green birefringence with Congo red, and detection of long, unbranched fibrils with a diameter of 4-6 nm. The high resistance of diapause II embryos to water stress is not correlated with ontogenetic changes in the egg envelope.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to assess the predictors of time-to-lupus renal disease in Latin American patients. METHODS: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (n = 1480) from Grupo Latino Americano De Estudio de Lupus (GLADEL's) longitudinal inception cohort were studied. Endpoint was ACR renal criterion development after SLE diagnosis (prevalent cases excluded). Renal disease predictors were examined by univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Antimalarials were considered time dependent in alternative analyses. RESULTS: Of the entire cohort, 265 patients (17.9%) developed renal disease after entering the cohort. Of them, 88 (33.2%) developed persistent proteinuria, 44 (16.6%) cellular casts and 133 (50.2%) both; 233 patients (87.9%) were women; mean (+/- SD) age at diagnosis was 28.0 (11.9) years; 12.2% were African-Latin Americans, 42.5% Mestizos, and 45.3% Caucasians (p = 0.0016). Mestizo ethnicity (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.19-2.17), hypertension (HR 3.99, 95% CI 3.02-5.26) and SLEDAI at diagnosis (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06) were associated with a shorter time-to-renal disease occurrence; antimalarial use (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.77), older age at onset (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85-0.95, for every five years) and photosensitivity (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98) were associated with a longer time. Alternative model results were consistent with the antimalarial protective effect (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly support the fact that Mestizo patients are at increased risk of developing renal disease early while antimalarials seem to delay the appearance of this SLE manifestation. These data have important implications for the treatment of these patients regardless of their geographic location.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reversible modification of proteins through the attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers is an essential post-translational regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes. The conjugation of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins has been demonstrated to play roles in growth, adaptation and homeostasis in all eukaryotes, with perturbation of ubiquitin-mediated systems associated with the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe the use of an HMM search of functional Pfam domains found in the key components of the ubiquitin-mediated pathway necessary to activate and reversibly modify target proteins in eight apicomplexan parasitic protozoa for which complete or late-stage genome projects exist. In parallel, the same search was conducted on five model organisms, single-celled and metazoans, to generate data to validate both the search parameters employed and aid paralog classification in Apicomplexa. For each of the 13 species investigated, a set of proteins predicted to be involved in the ubiquitylation pathway has been identified and demonstrates increasing component members of the ubiquitylation pathway correlating with organism and genome complexity. Sequence homology and domain architecture analyses facilitated prediction of apicomplexan-specific protein function, particularly those involved in regulating cell division during these parasite's complex life cycles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of proteins predicted to be involved in the apicomplexan ubiquitin-mediated pathway. Given the importance of such pathway in a wide variety of cellular processes, our data is a key step in elucidating the biological networks that, in part, direct the pathogenicity of these parasites resulting in a massive impact on global health. Moreover, apicomplexan-specific adaptations of the ubiquitylation pathway may represent new therapeutic targets for much needed drugs against apicomplexan parasites.},

   abstract = {Newly released human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles obligatorily undergo a maturation process to become infectious. The HIV-1 protease (PR) initiates this step, catalyzing the cleavage of the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol structural polyproteins. Proper organization of the mature virus core requires that cleavage of these polyprotein substrates proceeds in a highly regulated, specific series of events. The vital role the HIV-1 PR plays in the viral life cycle has made it an extremely attractive target for inhibition and has accordingly fostered the development of a number of highly potent substrate-analog inhibitors. Though the PR inhibitors (PIs) inhibit only the HIV-1 PR, their effects manifest at multiple different stages in the life cycle due to the critical importance of the PR in preparing the virus for these subsequent events. Effectively, PIs masquerade as entry inhibitors, reverse transcription inhibitors, and potentially even inhibitors of post-reverse transcription steps. In this chapter, we review the triple threat of PIs: the intermolecular cooperativity in the form of a cooperative dose-response for inhibition in which the apparent potency increases with increasing inhibition; the pleiotropic effects of HIV-1 PR inhibition on entry, reverse transcription, and post-reverse transcription steps; and their potency as transition state analogs that have the potential for further improvement that could lead to an inability of the virus to evolve resistance in the context of single drug therapy.},

   abstract = {Protein structure-function relationships can be studied by using linker insertion mutagenesis, which efficiently identifies essential regions in target proteins. Bacteriophage Mu in vitro DNA transposition was used to generate an extensive library of pentapeptide insertion mutants within the alpha-complementing domain 1 of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, yielding mutants at 100% efficiency. Each mutant contained an accurate 15-bp insertion that translated to five additional amino acids within the protein, and the insertions were distributed essentially randomly along the target sequence. Individual mutants (alpha-donors) were analyzed for their ability to restore (by alpha-complementation) beta-galactosidase activity of the M15 deletion mutant (alpha-acceptor), and the data were correlated to the structure of the beta-galactosidase tetramer. Most of the insertions were well tolerated, including many of those disrupting secondary structural elements even within the protein's interior. Nevertheless, certain sites were sensitive to mutations, indicating both known and previously unknown regions of functional importance. Inhibitory insertions within the N-terminus and loop regions most likely influenced protein tetramerization via direct local effects on protein-protein interactions. Within the domain 1 core, the insertions probably caused either lateral shifting of the polypeptide chain toward the protein's exterior or produced more pronounced structural distortions. Six percent of the mutant proteins exhibited temperature sensitivity, in general suggesting the method's usefulness for generation of conditional phenotypes. The method should be applicable to any cloned protein-encoding gene.},

The sequential arrangement of the chemical, physical and conformational properties of the signal and nascent amino acid sequences of the translocated proteins has been compiled and analysed in the present study. The sequence data of 126 signal peptides of length between 18 and 21 residues form the basis of this study. The statistical distribution of the following properties was studied hydrophobicity, Mr, bulkiness, chromatographic index and preference for adopting alpha-helical, beta-sheet and turn structures. The contribution of each property to the sequence arrangement was derived. A hydrophobic core sequence was found in all signal peptides investigated. The structural arrangement of the cleavage site was also clearly revealed by this study. Most of the physical properties of the individual sequences correlated (correlation coefficient approximately 0.4) very well with the average distribution. The preferred occupancy of amino acid residues in the signal and nascent sequences was also calculated and correlated with their property distribution. The periodic behaviour of the signal and nascent chains was revealed by calculating their hydrophobic moments for various repetitive conformations. A graphical analysis of average hydrophobic moments versus average hydrophobicity of peptides revealed the transmembrane characteristics of signal peptides and globular characteristics of the nascent peptides.},

The acquired resistance is primarily due to hyper activation of HER2 downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Hence, identification of inhibitors of components of this pathway, particularly mTOR, is an area of intense investigation. Interestingly, mTOR specific inhibitors (rapamycin/rapalogs) have been tested and shown to potentiate the effect of HER2 inhibitors. However, the use of mTOR inhibitors will also be associated with the limitations inherently linked with extensive use of anticancer drugs e.g., toxicity and acquired drug resistance. Hereby, we hypothesize development of an alternative novel molecular therapeutic intervention based on cell penetrating peptide (CPP), a highly efficient carrier, conjugated to zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), a precise molecular scissor. The use of HER2 specific CPP conjugated to mTOR specific ZFN, will make the mTOR locus non-functional and inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, essential for growth and proliferation of cancerous cells. With the availability of HER21 cancerous cell specific CPP and proved applications of ZFN in targeted genome engineering of over 11 species, the prospects of success of CPP-ZFN anti-cancer therapy are very high.},

Functional analysis indicated that the mutated CD40 was translocated to the CD40 signalosome and involved in CD40 signal transduction.

However, proton magnetic resonance studies at high dilution in deuteriated solvents show that N-methylformamide exists as the cis isomer to the extent of 8% in water, 10.3% in chloroform, 8.8% in benzene, and 9.2% in cyclohexane. Integrated intensities of proton and carbon resonances show that N-methylacetamide exists as the cis isomer to the extent of only 1.5% in water, not changing much in nonpolar solvents. Quantum mechanical calculations using the 6-31G basis set reproduce these relative abundances with reasonable accuracy and show that there is little difference between the dipole moments of the cis and trans isomers, for either amide. The remarkable insensitivity of cis/trans equilibria to the solvent environment and the heavy preponderance of trans isomers regardless of the polarity of the surroundings (ca. 98.5% for N-methylacetamide, whose properties may resemble those of a typical peptide bond) accord with the overwhelming preference of peptide bonds for the trans configuration that is consistently observed in the three-dimensional structures of globular proteins.},

   abstract = {MuA transposase protein is a member of the retroviral integrase superfamily (RISF). It catalyzes DNA cleavage and joining reactions via an initial assembly and subsequent structural transitions of a protein-DNA complex, known as the Mu transpososome, ultimately attaching transposon DNA to non-specific target DNA. The transpososome functions as a molecular DNA-modifying machine and has been used in a wide variety of molecular biology and genetics/genomics applications. To analyze structure-function relationships in MuA action, a comprehensive pentapeptide insertion mutagenesis was carried out for the protein. A total of 233 unique insertion variants were generated, and their activity was analyzed using a quantitative in vivo DNA transposition assay. The results were then correlated with the known MuA structures, and the data were evaluated with regard to the protein domain function and transpososome development. To complement the analysis with an evolutionary component, a protein sequence alignment was produced for 44 members of MuA family transposases. Altogether, the results pinpointed those regions, in which insertions can be tolerated, and those where insertions are harmful. Most insertions within the subdomains Igamma, IIalpha, IIbeta, and IIIalpha completely destroyed the transposase function, yet insertions into certain loop/linker regions of these subdomains increased the protein activity. Subdomains Ialpha and IIIbeta were largely insertion-tolerant. The comprehensive structure-function data set will be useful for designing MuA transposase variants with improved properties for biotechnology/genomics applications, and is informative with regard to the function of RISF proteins in general.},

   abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite which infects nearly one third of the human population and is found in an extraordinary range of vertebrate hosts. Its epidemiology depends heavily on horizontal transmission, especially between rodents and its definitive host, the cat. Neospora caninum is a recently discovered close relative of Toxoplasma, whose definitive host is the dog. Both species are tissue-dwelling Coccidia and members of the phylum Apicomplexa; they share many common features, but Neospora neither infects humans nor shares the same wide host range as Toxoplasma, rather it shows a striking preference for highly efficient vertical transmission in cattle. These species therefore provide a remarkable opportunity to investigate mechanisms of host restriction, transmission strategies, virulence and zoonotic potential. We sequenced the genome of N. caninum and transcriptomes of the invasive stage of both species, undertaking an extensive comparative genomics and transcriptomics analysis. We estimate that these organisms diverged from their common ancestor around 28 million years ago and find that both genomes and gene expression are remarkably conserved. However, in N. caninum we identified an unexpected expansion of surface antigen gene families and the divergence of secreted virulence factors, including rhoptry kinases. Specifically we show that the rhoptry kinase ROP18 is pseudogenised in N. caninum and that, as a possible consequence, Neospora is unable to phosphorylate host immunity-related GTPases, as Toxoplasma does. This defense strategy is thought to be key to virulence in Toxoplasma. We conclude that the ecological niches occupied by these species are influenced by a relatively small number of gene products which operate at the host-parasite interface and that the dominance of vertical transmission in N. caninum may be associated with the evolution of reduced virulence in this species.},

In this article, we estimate the number of under-five deaths caused by ineffective treatment of malaria associated with consumption of poor-quality antimalarials in 39 sub-Saharan countries. Using Latin hypercube sampling our estimates were calculated as the product of the number of private sector antimalarials consumed by malaria-positive children in 2013; the proportion of private sector antimalarials consumed that were of poor-quality; and the case fatality rate (CFR) of under-five malaria-positive children who did not receive appropriate treatment. An estimated 122,350 (interquartile range [IQR]: 91,577-154,736) under-five malaria deaths were associated with consumption of poor-quality antimalarials, representing 3.75% (IQR: 2.81-4.75%) of all under-five deaths in our sample of 39 countries. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding our results because of gaps in data on case fatality rates and prevalence of poor-quality antimalarials. Our analysis highlights the need for further investigation into the distribution of poor-quality antimalarials and the need for stronger surveillance and regulatory efforts to prevent the sale of poor-quality antimalarials.},

   abstract = {Discovery of novel effective and safe antimalarials has been traditionally focused on targeting erythrocytic parasite stages that cause clinical symptoms. However, elimination of malaria parasites from the human population will be facilitated by intervention at different life-cycle stages of the parasite, including the obligatory developmental phase in the liver, which precedes the erythrocytic stage. We have previously reported that N-Mannich-based quinolon-4(1H)-imines are potent antiplasmodial agents but present several stability liabilities. We now report our efforts to optimize quinolon-4(1H)-imines as dual-stage antiplasmodial agents endowed with chemical and metabolic stability. We report compounds active against both the erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic forms of malaria parasites, such as the quinolon-4(1H)-imine 5p (IC50 values of 54 and 710 nM against the erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic forms), which constitute excellent starting points for further lead optimization as dual-stage antimalarials.},

In this paper we expand upon this work by making use of the more powerful class of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Our model, Philius, is inspired by a previously published HMM, Phobius, and combines a signal peptide submodel with a transmembrane submodel. We introduce a two-stage DBN decoder that combines the power of posterior decoding with the grammar constraints of Viterbi-style decoding. Philius also provides protein type, segment, and topology confidence metrics to aid in the interpretation of the predictions. We report a relative improvement of 13% over Phobius in full-topology prediction accuracy on transmembrane proteins, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 in detecting signal peptides. We also show that our confidence metrics correlate well with the observed precision. In addition, we have made predictions on all 6.3 million proteins in the Yeast Resource Center (YRC) database. This large-scale study provides an overall picture of the relative numbers of proteins that include a signal-peptide and/or one or more transmembrane segments as well as a valuable resource for the scientific community. All DBNs are implemented using the Graphical Models Toolkit. Source code for the models described here is available at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/philius.

The shikimate pathway is an attractive target for herbicides and antimicrobial agents because it is essential in algae, higher plants, bacteria and fungi, but absent from mammals. Here we present biochemical, genetic and chemotherapeutic evidence for the presence of enzymes of the shikimate pathway in apicomplexan parasites. In vitro growth of Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) and Cryptosporidium parvum was inhibited by the herbicide glyphosate, a well-characterized inhibitor of the shikimate pathway enzyme 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate 3-phosphate synthase. This effect on T. gondii and P. falciparum was reversed by treatment with p-aminobenzoate, which suggests that the shikimate pathway supplies folate precursors for their growth. Glyphosate in combination with pyrimethamine limited T. gondii infection in mice. Four shikimate pathway enzymes were detected in extracts of T. gondii and glyphosate inhibited 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate 3-phosphate synthase activity. Genes encoding chorismate synthase, the final shikimate pathway enzyme, were cloned from T. gondii and P. falciparum. This discovery of a functional shikimate pathway in apicomplexan parasites provides several targets for the development of new antiparasite agents.},

Numerous real-time read-out technologies have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplification-based techniques, there are only few tools for pre-processing of amplification data. However, a transparent tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable in several scenarios, for example, during the development of new instruments. RESULTS: chipPCR is an R: package for the pre-processing and quality analysis of raw data of amplification curves. The package takes advantage of R: 's S4 object model and offers an extensible environment. chipPCR contains tools for raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, imputation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to detect the start and end of an amplification curve. The capabilities of the software are enhanced by the implementation of algorithms unavailable in R: , such as a 5-point stencil for derivative interpolation. Simulation tools, statistical tests, plots for data quality management, amplification efficiency/quantification cycle calculation, and datasets from qPCR and qIA experiments are part of the package. Core functionalities are integrated in GUIs (web-based and standalone shiny applications), thus streamlining analysis and report generation.

Furthermore, de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in malaria parasites, particularly dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), is also receiving increasing attention. The enzymes involved in the mtETC are valuable targets in malaria chemotherapy, not only because they play a critical role in metabolic pathways of P. falciparum, but also because they differ significantly from the analogous mammalian system. Inhibition of such enzymes results in the shutdown of mitochondrial electron flow, leading to the arrest of pyrimidine biosynthesis and consequent parasite death. In this review, we aim to outline recent advances in the inhibition of mitochondrial metabolic pathways, highlighting the major classes of known inhibitors and those that are currently being developed.},

   abstract = {Several papers have been published where nonlinear machine learning algorithms, e.g. artificial neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees, have been used to model the specificity of the HIV-1 protease and extract specificity rules. We show that the dataset used in these studies is linearly separable and that it is a misuse of nonlinear classifiers to apply them to this problem. The best solution on this dataset is achieved using a linear classifier like the simple perceptron or the linear support vector machine, and it is straightforward to extract rules from these linear models. We identify key residues in peptides that are efficiently cleaved by the HIV-1 protease and list the most prominent rules, relating them to experimental results for the HIV-1 protease.
MOTIVATION: Understanding HIV-1 protease specificity is important when designing HIV inhibitors and several different machine learning algorithms have been applied to the problem. However, little progress has been made in understanding the specificity because nonlinear and overly complex models have been used.
RESULTS: We show that the problem is much easier than what has previously been reported and that linear classifiers like the simple perceptron or linear support vector machines are at least as good predictors as nonlinear algorithms. We also show how sets of specificity rules can be generated from the resulting linear classifiers.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bloom syndrome (BS) is characterized by mutations within the BLM gene. The Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) has similarity to the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicases, which contain seven conserved helicase domains and share significant sequence and structural similarity with the Rep and PcrA DNA helicases. We modeled the three-dimensional structure of the BLM helicase domain to analyze the structural basis of BS-causing mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sequence alignment was performed for RecQ DNA helicases and Rep and PcrA helicases. The crystal structure of PcrA helicase (PDB entry 3PJR) was used as the template for modeling the BLM helicase domain. The model was used to infer the function of BLM and to analyze the effect of the mutations. RESULTS: The structural model with good stereochemistry of the BLM helicase domain contains two subdomains, 1A and 2A. The electrostatic potential of the model is highly negative over most of the surface, except for the cleft between subdomains 1A and 2A which is similar to the template protein. The ATP-binding site is located inside the model between subdomains 1A and 2A; whereas, the DNA-binding region is situated at the surface cleft, with positive potential between 1A and 2A. CONCLUSIONS: The three-dimensional structure of the BLM helicase domain was modeled and applied to interpret BS-causing mutations. The mutation I841T is likely to weaken DNA binding, while the mutations C891R, C901Y, and Q672R presumably disturb the ATP binding. In addition, other critical positions are discussed.},

The N-terminus of the cytoplasmic WAS protein (WASP) has similarity to WH1 domains, which recognize proline-rich sequences and direct protein localization and formation of multicomponent assemblies. About one-half of the WAS-causing mutations affect the WH1 domain, but this forms only about one-fifth of the length of the protein. To understand the structural and functional effects of WAS-causing mutations within the WH1 domain, the three-dimensional model of the WASP WH1 domain was constructed based on the crystal structures of the Mena and Ev1 EVH1 (WH1) domains. Based on the model, the protein structural effects of the mutations were evaluated and putative ligand-binding regions identified. Mutations in the WASP WH1 domain were found to influence both the function and structure of the WASP. The amino acid substitutions cause general and local structural changes because of steric clashes and changes to the positions of adjacent strands and the fold of the protein. Some mutations alter the electrostatics and interactions with partners and other domains of WASP.},

Because it can be used to make measurements at night, the system has a significant advantage for measuring polar constituents in winter, when conditions that might give rise to ozone loss are initiated. Other advantages arise from the use of a cooled two-dimensional CCD array as the detector: an array detector avoids spectral noise resulting from scintillation of stars or from clouds passing overhead and allows for the possibility of measuring several constituents simultaneously; its second dimension permits auroral light from the atmosphere adjacent to the star to be measured simultaneously and subtracted from the stellar light, and a modern low-noise CCD allows us to use a telescope of modest diameter. The few previous measurements of constituents made by the use of stellar absorption did not have these advantages. The instrument was configured for simplicity and ease of use in field measurements and was deployed outside in winter in Northern Sweden in 1991. Examples of ozone measurements are shown.},

In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the effect of chloroquine on cholesterol levels of a Brazilian population with SLE. Sixty patients were studied, 95% females. Mean age was 48.7 years (SD 13.3 years). Overweight or obesity was documented in 27 cases (45%). Thirty-four patients (56.6%) were using chloroquine in standard dosage, while 33 (55%) were on corticosteroids. Hypercholesterolemia was present in 26 patients (43.3%), while low HDL cholesterol levels were seen in 18 cases (30%). Normal cholesterolemia was documented equally in users and non-users of antimalarials (P > 0.20). After adjustment for statin and corticosteroid intake by multivariate analysis, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels did not significantly differ in users or non-users of chloroquine (P > 0.05). There was no association of chloroquine intake with low body mass index (P = 0.314). Our findings suggest that antimalarial intake by itself does not distinguish cholesterol profiles in SLE patients.},

AREA COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: In the present review, we focus on the current knowledge of QSARs and pharmacophore models of different classes of antimalarial drugs. In this context, we also review the reported docking studies of antimalarial compounds acting on different targets to explore the interaction pattern at the molecular level. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain an overview of advances of QSAR and related theoretical models of antimalarial drug compounds. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: This review infers that most of the reported QSAR models are analog based QSARs with a limited applicability domain, but QSAR models based on diverse chemical structures acting on a particular target have been reported in very few cases.},

   abstract = {Trophozoites of gregarine apicomplexans are large feeding cells with diverse morphologies that have played a prominent role in gregarine systematics. The range of variability in trophozoite shapes and sizes can be very high even within a single species depending on developmental stages and host environmental conditions; this makes the delimitation of different species of gregarines based on morphological criteria alone very difficult. Accordingly, comparisons of morphological variability and molecular variability in gregarines are necessary to provide a pragmatic framework for establishing species boundaries within this diverse and poorly understood group of parasites. We investigated the morphological and molecular variability present in the gregarine Lecudina cf. tuzetae from the intestines of Nereis vexillosa (Polychaeta) collected in two different locations in Canada. Three distinct morphotypes of trophozoites were identified and the small subunit (SSU) rDNA was sequenced either from multicell isolates of the same morphotype or from single cells. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the different morphotypes and localities reflected phylogenetic relatedness as inferred from the SSU rDNA sequence data. Phylogenetic analyses of the SSU rDNA demonstrated that the new sequences did not cluster according to morphotype or locality and instead were intermingled within a strongly supported clade. A comparison of 1,657 bp from 45 new sequences demonstrated divergences between 0% and 3.9%. These data suggest that it is necessary to acquire both morphological and molecular data in order to effectively delimit the "clouds" of variation associated with each gregarine species and to unambiguously reidentify these species in the future.},

A previous study of the incomplete genome of the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum reports a higher than expected enrichment of poly dA.dT tracts, far above that anticipated even in this highly AT rich genome. Here we report an analysis of the relative frequency, length and spatial arrangement of homopolymer tracts for the complete P. falciparum genome, extending this analysis to twelve additional genomes of Apicomplexan parasites important to human and animal health. In addition, using nucleosome-positioning data available for P. falciparum, we explore the correlation of poly dA.dT tracts with nucleosome-positioning data over key expression landmarks within intergenic regions. RESULTS: We describe three apparent lineage-specific patterns of homopolymeric tract organization within the intergenic regions of these Apicomplexan parasites. Moreover, a striking pattern of enrichment of overly long poly dA.dT tracts in the intergenic regions of Plasmodium spp. uniquely extends into protein coding sequences. There is a conserved spatial arrangement of poly dA.dT immediately flanking open reading frames and over predicted core promoter sites. These key landmarks are all relatively depleted in nucleosomes in P. falciparum, as would be expected for poly dA.dT acting as nucleosome exclusion sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Previous comparative studies of homopolymer tract organization emphasize evolutionary diversity; this is the first report of such an analysis within a single phylum. Our data provide insights into the evolution of homopolymeric tracts and the selective pressures at play in their maintenance and expansion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene has been shown to be mutated in the human immunodeficiency disease, XLA (X-linked agammaglobulinemia). Btk is a member of the Tec family of cytosolic protein tyrosine kinases with distinct functional domains PH, TH, SH3, SH2, and kinase. Mutations have been observed in each of the Btk subdomains in XLA. We have analyzed the Btk gene in six XLA patients from five unrelated families. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was prepared from the patients peripheral blood. The Btk exons including the junctional sequences were analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by direct nucleotide sequencing after PCR-amplification. For structural analysis, the missense mutations were introduced into three-dimensional models of the PH and kinase domains of Btk and the outcome was predicted based on the knowledge of the protein function. RESULTS: Five novel mutations and two novel polymorphisms, all of which resulted from single-base alterations, were identified. Three of the five mutations were in the PH domain and two were in the kinase domain of Btk. Three of these mutations were of the missense type, two of which altered the same codon in the PH domain; the third one was located in the kinase domain. The fourth mutation was a point deletion in the PH domain causing a frameshift followed by premature termination. The fifth mutation was a splice donor-site mutation within the kinase domain which could result in an exon skipping. In four of the five instances, mothers of the patients were shown to be obligate carriers. In one instance, a sibling sister was identified as a heterozygote establishing her as a carrier. CONCLUSIONS: Functional consequences of the mutations causing frameshifts and altered splicing can be inferred directly. Functional consequences of the missense mutations were interpreted by 3-dimensional structural modeling of Btk domains. It is proposed that the two PH domain mutations will interfere with membrane localization while the kinase domain mutation will interfere with the enzymatic function of Btk. This study provides further insight into the role of Btk in XLA.},

   abstract = {Jak tyrosine kinases have a unique domain structure containing a kinase domain (JH1) adjacent to a catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain (JH2). JH2 is crucial for inhibition of basal Jak activity, but the mechanism of this regulation has remained elusive. We show that JH2 negatively regulated Jak2 in bacterial cells, indicating that regulation is an intrinsic property of Jak2. JH2 suppressed basal Jak2 activity by lowering the V(max) of Jak2, whereas JH2 did not affect the K(m) of Jak2 for a peptide substrate. Three inhibitory regions (IR1-3) within JH2 were identified. IR3 (residues 758-807), at the C terminus of JH2, directly inhibited JH1, suggesting an inhibitory interaction between IR3 and JH1. Molecular modeling of JH2 showed that IR3 could form a stable alpha-helical fold, supporting that IR3 could independently inhibit JH1. IR2 (725-757) in the C-terminal lobe of JH2, and IR1 (619-670), extending from the N-terminal to the C-terminal lobe, enhanced IR3-mediated inhibition of JH1. Disruption of IR3 either by mutations or a small deletion increased basal Jak2 activity, but abolished interferon-gamma-inducible signaling. Together, the results provide evidence for autoinhibition of a Jak family kinase and identify JH2 regions important for autoregulation of Jak2.},

The nutrients required by these intracellular parasites to support their high rate of growth and replication originate from the host cell which, in turn, takes up such compounds from the extracellular milieu. Solutes moving from the external medium to the interior of the parasite, are confronted by a series of three membranes --the host cell membrane, the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the parasite plasma membrane. Each constitutes a potential permeability barrier which must be either crossed or bypassed. It is the mechanisms by which this occurs that are the subject of this review.},

   abstract = {Early diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can improve long-term prognosis. MTC can be detected at an early stage by calcitonin screening in all patients with thyroid nodules. This approach, however, is controversial due to high costs and a limited specificity of calcitonin. It was the aim of the present study to investigate whether ultrasonography may contribute to the diagnosis of MTC in patients with thyroid nodules. The study included 19 patients with newly diagnosed MTC. Ten patients had sporadic MTC, 7 had multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A, and 2 patients had MEN 2B. In all subjects conventional ultrasound, and in 14 patients color Doppler sonography were performed before primary surgery. For comparison, ultrasound appearance of 139 benign thyroid nodules was evaluated. In conventional ultrasound, MTC in 17/19 (89%) patients were hypoechoic, contained intranodular calcifications, and had no "halo sign". The combination of these criteria were found in only 8/139 (6%) of benign thyroid nodules. Intranodular blood flow was found in 11/14 patients with MTC (79%), perinodular blood flow in 7/14 MTC (50%). In conclusion, conventional ultrasound reveals a combination of hypoechogenicity, intranodular calcifications, and absence of "halo sign" in the vast majority of MTC. Since this sonographic pattern only rarely occurs in benign thyroid nodules, the results indicate that thyroid ultrasound can contribute to the diagnosis of MTC. In addition, the findings may have implications for calcitonin screening in nodular thyroid disease.},

   abstract = {B cells play a pivotal role in adaptive immune system, since they maintain a delicate balance between recognition and clearance of foreign pathogens and tolerance to self. During maturation, B cells progress through a series of developmental stages defined by specific phenotypic surface markers and the rearrangement and expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. To get insight into B cell proteome during the maturation pathway, we studied differential protein expression in eight human cell lines, which cover four distinctive developmental stages; early pre-B, pre-B, plasma cell and immature B cell upon anti-IgM stimulation. Our two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry based proteomic study indicates the involvement of large number of proteins with various functions. Notably, proteins related to cytoskeleton were relatively highly expressed in early pre-B and pre-B cells, whereas plasma cell proteome contained endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi system proteins. Our long time series analysis in anti-IgM stimulated Ramos B cells revealed the dynamic regulation of cytoskeleton organization, gene expression and metabolic pathways, among others. The findings are related to cellular processes in B cells and are discussed in relation to experimental information for the proteins and pathways they are involved in. Representative 2D-DIGE maps of different B cell maturation stages are available online at http://structure.bmc.lu.se/BcellProteome/.},

We investigated the proteome profiles of stimulated and nonstimulated Ramos B-cells at eight time points during 5 d and compared the obtained proteomic data to the corresponding data from DNA-microarray studies. Anti-mIgM stimulation of the cells resulted in significant differences (> or =twofold) in the protein abundance close to 100 proteins and differences in post-translational protein modifications. Forty-eight up- or down-regulated proteins were identified by mass spectrometric methods and database searches. The identities of a further nine proteins were revealed by comparing their positions to the known proteins in other lymphocyte 2-DE databases. Several of the proteins are directly related to the functional and morphological characteristics of B-cells, such as cytoskeleton rearrangement and intracellular signalling triggered by the crosslinking of B-cell receptors. In addition to proteins known to be involved in human B-cell maturation, we identified several proteins that were not previously linked to lymphocyte differentiation. The results provide deeper insights into the process of B-cell maturation and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for immunodeficiencies.

Some groups of diseases, such as primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), are especially hard to nosologically cluster due, on one hand, to the presence of a wide variety of disorders and, in contrast, because of overlapping characteristics. More than 200 PIDs affecting components of the innate and adaptive immune systems have been described. Clinical, pathological, and laboratory characteristics were collected and used to group PIDs. A consensus of at least five independent methods provided a novel classification of 11 groups, which revealed previously unknown features and relationships of PIDs. Comparison of the classification to independent features, including the severity and therapy of the diseases, functional classification of proteins, and network vulnerability, indicated a strong statistical support. The method can be applied to any group of diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ImmunoDeficiency Resource (IDR) is a knowledge base for the integration of the clinical, biochemical, genetic, genomic, proteomic, structural, and computational data of primary immunodeficiencies. The need for the IDR arises from the lack of structured and systematic information about primary immunodeficiencies on the Internet, and from the lack of a common platform which enables doctors, researchers, students, nurses and patients to find out validated information about these diseases. DESCRIPTION: The IDR knowledge base, first released in 1999, has grown substantially. It contains information for 158 diseases, both from a clinical as well as molecular point of view. The database and the user interface have been reformatted. This new IDR release has a richer and more complete breadth, depth and scope. The service provides the most complete and up-to-date dataset. The IDR has been integrated with several internal and external databases and services. The contents of the IDR are validated and selected for different types of users (doctors, nurses, researchers and students, as well as patients and their families). The search engine has been improved and allows either a detailed or a broad search from a simple user interface. CONCLUSION: The IDR is the first knowledge base specifically designed to capture in a systematic and validated way both clinical and molecular information for primary immunodeficiencies. The service is freely available at http://bioinf.uta.fi/idr and is regularly updated. The IDR facilitates primary immunodeficiencies informatics and helps to parameterise in silico modelling of these diseases. The IDR is useful also as an advanced education tool for medical students, and physicians.},

The information available from the Internet for over 200 PIDs is scattered between numerous services and databases. Patient information has been collected in different patient registries. Several software tools have been developed in order to build the databases, expert systems and other information systems useful in diagnosis or prediction. RECENT FINDINGS: Previously released services have been significantly improved and some new bioinformatics tools have been developed to help in diagnosis, prediction, mutation analysis and classification of PIDs. Several national initiatives have been launched for centralized PID information services. The very latest additions are tools and approaches for PID candidate gene prioritization, systematic classification and a medical expert system to help in diagnosis. SUMMARY: Many bioinformatics tools for PIDs are already freely available over the Internet. We expect bioinformatics tools to further help healthcare professionals in diagnosis, analysis and prediction. Currently, most of the resources are stand-alone and thus their integration will be a challenge for the future. Another challenge is to develop terminologies, ontologies and standards to achieve semantic interoperability.},

The rhoptry proteins reprogram the invaded host cell and participate in the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole in which the intracellular parasite resides and replicates. Disengagement of the invading parasite from the host cell receptors involves the action of at least one parasite plasma membrane rhomboid protease, which is concomitantly implicated in a checkpoint that signals the parasite to switch from an invasive to a replicative mode.},

We have re-examined and revised the sequence of the nuclear genes specifying organellar cochaperonins in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). One gene encodes a typical cochaperonin (PfCpn10) whereas the other (encoding PfCpn20) specifies two Cpn10 domains arranged in tandem as in plant chloroplasts. Transfection experiments using fluorescent reporters showed specific localization of PfCpn10 to the mitochondrion and PfCpn20 to the plastid. As P. falciparum also has two Cpn60s, one of which is targeted specifically to the mitochondrion and the other exclusively to the plastid, each organelle has a distinct type I chaperonin system. Comparative sequence analysis extended these findings to several other apicomplexan parasites that have both a mitochondrion and a plastid. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the Cpn10s and Cpn20s of apicomplexans are independently monophyletic. The apicomplexan Cpn10 is phylogenetically related to other mitochondrial versions but a significant relationship between apicomplexan Cpn20s and other cochaperonins was not established.},

A common criticism against such neural network models is that it is difficult to interpret the criteria that are used in making predictions. We address this concern with several new prediction methods that base predictions explicitly on the abundance of different amino acid types in the N-terminal region of the protein. Our successful prediction accuracy suggests that ChloroP uses little positional information in its decision-making; an unexpected result given the elaborate ChloroP input scheme. By removing positional information, our simpler methods allow us to identify those amino acids that are useful for successful prediction. The identification of important sequence features, such as amino acid content, is advantageous if one of the goals of localization predictors is to gain an understanding of the biological process of chloroplast localization. Our most accurate predictor combines principal component analysis and logistic regression. Web-based prediction using this method is available online at http://apicoplast.cis.upenn.edu/pclr/.},

   abstract = {Phosphodiester linkages, including those that join the nucleotides of DNA, are highly resistant to spontaneous hydrolysis. The rate of water attack at the phosphorus atom of phosphodiesters is known only as an upper limit, based on the hydrolysis of the dimethyl phosphate anion. That reaction was found to proceed at least 99% by C-O cleavage, at a rate suggesting an upper limit of 10(-15) s(-1) for P-O cleavage of phosphodiester anions at 25 degrees C. To evaluate the rate enhancement produced by P-O cleaving phosphodiesterases such as staphylococcal nuclease, we decided to establish the actual value of the rate constant for P-O cleavage of a simple phosphodiester anion. In dineopentyl phosphate, C-O cleavage is sterically precluded so that hydrolysis occurs only by P-O cleavage. Measurements at elevated temperatures indicate that the dineopentyl phosphate anion undergoes hydrolysis in water with a t(1/2) of 30,000,000 years at 25 degrees C, furnishing an indication of the resistance of the internucleotide linkages of DNA to water attack at phosphorus. These results imply that staphylococcal nuclease (k(cat) = 95 s(-1)) enhances the rate of phosphodiester hydrolysis by a factor of approximately 10(17). In alkaline solution, thymidylyl-3'-5'-thymidine (TpT) has been reported to decompose 10(5)-fold more rapidly than does dineopentyl phosphate. We find however that TpT and thymidine decompose at similar rates and with similar activation parameters, to a similar set of products, at pH 7 and in 1 M KOH. We infer that the decomposition of TpT is initiated by the breakdown of thymidine, not by phosphodiester hydrolysis.},

   abstract = {As a model for mechanistic comparison with peptidyl transfer within the ribosome, the reaction of aqueous glycinamide with N-formylphenylalanine trifluoroethyl ester (fPhe-TFE) represents an improvement over earlier model reactions involving Tris. The acidity of trifluoroethanol (pKa 12.4) resembles that of tRNA (12.98) more closely than do the acidities of model reactants described earlier, and the reactivity of the simple nucleophile glycinamide is free of potential complications that arise from alternative reaction pathways available to Tris. At 25 degrees C, the uncatalyzed reaction of glycinamide with fPhe-TFE proceeds with a second-order rate constant of 3 x 10(-5) M-1 s-1; DeltaH(++) = +7.8 kcal/mol; TDeltaS(++)= -15.7 kcal/mol. The ribosomal reaction of puromycin with fMet-tRNA proceeds 3 x 107-fold more rapidly, with a second-order rate constant (kcat/Km) of 1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1; DeltaH(++) = +16.0 kcal/mol; TDeltaS(++)= +2.0 kcal/mol. That rate enhancement, an order of magnitude larger than estimated earlier, is fully explained by the more favorable entropy of activation of the ribosomal reaction. Experiments involving ethylene glycol esters suggest that neighboring -OH group effects are negligible in the presence of solvent water, which itself acts as a general base catalyst. In the desolvated interior of the ribosome, the vicinal 2'-OH group of aminoacyl-tRNA probably replaces water as a general base catalyst. But the catalytic effect of the ribosome itself is overwhelmingly entropic in origin, suggesting that the ribosome achieves its effect by physical desolvation and/or juxtaposition of the reactants in a manner conducive to peptidyl transfer.},

   abstract = {To estimate the relative importance of alternate routes of spontaneous degradation of DNA and the rate enhancements produced by enzymes catalyzing these reactions, rate constants and thermodynamic activation parameters for the degradation of 2'-deoxynucleosides at 25 degrees C were determined by extrapolation of rates observed in the temperature range between 90 and 200 degrees C in neutral phosphate buffer. Rates of deamination of 2'-deoxycytidine, 1-methylcytosine, and cytidine were found to be identical within experimental error (t1/2 approximately 20 years, 37 degrees C). Rate constants for deamination of 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine, which could not be determined directly because of rapid glycoside cleavage, were estimated by assuming that methyl replacement should generate reasonable model substrates. The rates of deamination of 9-methyladenine and 9-methylguanine were found to be similar to each other (t1/2 approximately 6000 years, 37 degrees C) and approximately 10(2)-fold slower than the rates of glycoside cleavage in 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine. The deamination of 2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, and 2'-deoxycytidine led to accelerated rates of glycoside cleavage. In the exceptional case of 2'-deoxycytidine, deamination and glycoside hydrolysis proceed at very similar rates at all temperatures. Glycoside cleavage proceeds with half-times ranging from 4 years for 2'-deoxyinosine to 40 years for 2'-deoxycytidine (37 degrees C). The rate enhancements produced by DNA glycosylases, estimated by comparison with the rates of these uncatalyzed reactions, are found to be substantially smaller than those produced by deaminases and staphylococcal nuclease.},

On the basis of its entropic origin, that shortfall was tentatively ascribed to the trapping of a water molecule in the enzyme-inhibitor complex, as had been observed earlier for product uridine [Snider, M. J., and Wolfenden, R. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 11364-11371]. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) of CDA nebularized in the presence of saturating 5-fluorozebularine reveals peaks corresponding to the masses of E(2)Zn(2)W(2) (dimeric Zn-CDA with two water molecules), E(2)Zn(2)W(2)Fz, and E(2)Zn(2)W(2)Fz(2), where Fz represents the 3,4-hydrate of 5-fluorozebularine. In the absence of an inhibitor, E(2)Zn(2) is the only dimeric species detected, with no additional water molecules. Experiments conducted in H(2)(18)O indicate that the added mass W represents a trapped water molecule rather than an isobaric ammonium ion. This appears to represent the first identification of an enzyme-bound water molecule at a subunit interface (active site) using FTICR-MS. The presence of a 5-fluoro group appears to retard the decomposition of the inhibitory complex kinetically in the vapor phase, as no additional dimeric complexes (other than E(2)Zn(2)) are observed when zebularine is used in place of 5-fluorozebularine. Substrate competition assays show that in solution zebularine is released from CDA (k(off) > 0.14 s(-1)) much more rapidly than is 5-fluorozebularine (k(off) = 0.014 s(-1)), despite the greater thermodynamic stability of the zebularine complex.},

A crucial difference, however, between these filters and our implementation is that our fully automated smoothing filter requires no parameter specification or parameter optimization. Results are comparable to, or better than, Savitzky-Golay filters with optimized parameters and superior to the automated iterative median filter. Our approach, because it is based on the highly familiar moving average concept, is intuitive, fast, and straightforward to implement and should therefore be of immediate and considerable practical use in a wide variety of spectroscopy applications.},

They alone affect several hundred million people worldwide so that new drugs, especially for plasmodial infections, are urgently needed. This review will focus on a recently emerged, potential drug target, a plant-type redox system consisting of ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase (FNR) and its redox partner, ferredoxin (Fd). Both reside in an unique organelle of these parasites, named apicoplast, which is of algal origin. The apicoplast has been shown to be required for pathogen survival. In addition to other pathways already identified in this compartment, the FNR/Fd redox system represents a promising drug target because homologous proteins are not present in host organisms. Furthermore, a wealth of structural information exists on the closely related plant proteins, which can be exploited for structure-function studies of the apicomplexan protein pair. T. gondii and P. falciparum FNRs have been cloned, and the T. gondii enzyme was shown to be a flavoprotein active as a NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase. Both phylogenetic and biochemical analyses indicate that T. gondii FNR is similar in function to the isoform present in non-photosynthetic plastids whereby electron flow is from NADPH to oxidized Fd. The resulting reduced Fd is then presumably used as a reductant for various target enzymes whose nature is just starting to emerge. Among the likely candidates is the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway, which is also located in the apicoplast and dependent on reducing power. Furthermore, lipoic acid synthase and enzymes of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway may be other conceivable targets. Since all these metabolic steps are vital for the parasite, blocking electron flow from FNR to Fd by inhibition of either FNR activity or its molecular interaction with Fd should also interfere with these pathways, ultimately killing the parasite. Although the three-dimensional structure of FNR from T. gondii is not yet known, experimental and computational evidence shows that apicomplexan and plant enzymes are very similar in structure. Furthermore, single amino acid changes can have profound effects on the enzyme activity and affinity for Fd. This knowledge may be exploited for the design of inhibitors of protein-protein interaction. On the other hand, specifically tailored NAD(P) analogues or mimetics based on previously described substances might be useful lead compounds for apicomplexan FNR inhibitors.},

We propose a statistic method to compare extensions of the functionally important regions of apicoplast-targeted proteins. More specifically, we provide a comparison of extension lengths of orthologous apicoplast-targeted proteins in apicomplexan parasites. We focus on results obtained for the model species T. gondii, Neospora caninum, and Plasmodium falciparum. With our method, cross species comparisons demonstrate that, in average, apicoplast-targeted protein extensions in T. gondii are 1.5-fold longer than in N. caninum and 2-fold longer than in P. falciparum. Extensions in P. falciparum less than 87 residues in size are longer than the corresponding extensions in N. caninum and, reversely, are shorter if they exceed 88 residues.},

A number of apicomplexan genomes have been sequenced, but the accurate annotation of gene function remains challenging. We have adopted an approach called metabolic reconstruction, in which genes are systematically assigned to functions within pathways/networks for Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Cryptosporidium and Theileria species, and Babesia bovis. Several functions missing from pathways have been identified, where the corresponding gene for an essential process appears to be absent from the current genome annotation. For each species, LAMP contains interactive diagrams of each pathway, hyperlinked to external resources and annotated with detailed information, including the sources of evidence used. We have also developed a section to highlight the overall metabolic capabilities of each species, such as the ability to synthesize or the dependence on the host for a particular metabolite.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cells react to changing intra- and extracellular signals by dynamically modulating complex biochemical networks. Cellular responses to extracellular signals lead to changes in gene and protein expression. Since the majority of genes encode proteins, we investigated possible correlations between protein parameters and gene expression patterns to identify proteome-wide characteristics indicative of trends common to expressed proteins. RESULTS: Numerous bioinformatics methods were used to filter and merge information regarding gene and protein annotations. A new statistical time point-oriented analysis was developed for the study of dynamic correlations in large time series data. The method was applied to investigate microarray datasets for different cell types, organisms and processes, including human B and T cell stimulation, Drosophila melanogaster life span, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. CONCLUSION: We show that the properties of proteins synthesized correlate dynamically with the gene expression profile, indicating that not only is the actual identity and function of expressed proteins important for cellular responses but that several physicochemical and other protein properties correlate with gene expression as well. Gene expression correlates strongly with amino acid composition, composition- and sequence-derived variables, functional, structural, localization and gene ontology parameters. Thus, our results suggest that a dynamic relationship exists between proteome properties and gene expression in many biological systems, and therefore this relationship is fundamental to understanding cellular mechanisms in health and disease.},

   abstract = {A huge quantity of gene and protein sequences have become available during the post-genomic era, and information about genetic variations, including amino acid substitutions and SNPs, is accumulating rapidly. To understand the effects of these changes, it is often essential to apply bioinformatics tools. Where there is a lack of homologous sequences or a three-dimensional structure, it becomes essential to predict the effects of mutations based solely on protein sequence information. Several computational methods utilizing machine learning techniques have been developed. These predictions generally use the 20-alphabet amino acid code to train the model. With limited available data, the 20-alphabet amino acid features may introduce so many parameters that the model becomes over-fitted. To decrease the number of parameters, we propose a physicochemical feature-based method to forecast the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein stability. Protein structure alterations caused by mutations can be classified as stabilizing or destabilizing. Based on experimental folding-unfolding free energy (DeltaDeltaG) values, we trained a support vector machine with a cleaned data set. The physicochemical properties of the mutated residues, the number of neighboring residues in the primary sequence and the temperature and pH were used as input attributes. Different kernel functions, attributes and window sizes were optimized. An average accuracy of 80% was obtained in cross-validation experiments.},

   abstract = {One defining feature of apicomplexan parasites is their special ability to actively invade host cells. Although rapid, invasion is a complicated process that requires coordinated activities of host cell attachment, protein secretion, and motility by the parasite. Central to this process is the establishment of a structure called moving junction (MJ), which forms a tight connection between invading parasite and host cell membranes through which the parasite passes to enter into the host. Although recognized microscopically for decades, molecular characterization of the MJ was only enabled by the recent discovery of components that make up this multi-protein complex. Exciting progress made during the past few years on both the structure and function of the components of the MJ is reviewed here.},

To analyze the basis of this disease with respect to protein structure, we studied the relationships between PH domain sequences and structures by comparing sequence-based profiles of physicochemical properties and solvent accessibility profiles. The diversity of the distribution of amino acids was measured by calculating entropies for sequences containing mutations at different positions in multiple sequence alignments. Mutual information was calculated to quantify positional covariation. Eight conserved extrema were apparent in all profiles. The majority of the XLA disease-causing mutations in the Btk PH domain were found at positions having significant mutual information, indicating that there are covariant constraints for both structure and function. Together with additional structural analyses, all the XLA mutations that were analyzed could be explained at the molecular level. The method developed here is applicable to the design of mutations for protein engineering.},

   abstract = {With the avalanche of newly-found protein sequences emerging in the post genomic era, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method for fast and reliably identifying their subcellular locations because knowledge thus obtained can provide key clues for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. However, predicting subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins is a challenging problem, particularly when unknown query proteins do not have significant homology to proteins of known subcellular locations and when more locations need to be covered. To cope with the challenge, protein samples are formulated by hybridizing the information derived from the gene ontology database and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition. Based on such a representation, a novel ensemble hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. Each of these basic classifiers was engineered by the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) principle. As a demonstration, a new benchmark dataset was constructed that covers the following 18 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole, (3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7) endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) hydrogenosome, (11) lysosome, (12) mitochondria, (13) nucleus, (14) peroxisome, (15) plasma membrane, (16) plastid, (17) spindle pole body, and (18) vacuole. To avoid the homology bias, none of the proteins included has > or =25% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the 5-fold and jackknife cross-validation tests were 81.6 and 80.3%, respectively, which were 40-50% higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same strict dataset. The powerful predictor, named "Euk-PLoc", is available as a web-server at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/euk . Furthermore, to support the need of people working in the relevant areas, a downloadable file will be provided at the same website to list the results predicted by Euk-PLoc for all eukaryotic protein entries (excluding fragments) in Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations or are annotated as being uncertain. The large-scale results will be updated twice a year to include the new entries of eukaryotic proteins and reflect the continuous development of Euk-PLoc.},

   pages = {297-303},
   abstract = {Functioning as an "address tag" that directs nascent proteins to their proper cellular and extracellular locations, signal peptides have become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells for gene therapy. To effectively and timely use such a tool, however, the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant, animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences, respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-3L that consists of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing many individual OET-KNN (optimized evidence-theoretic K nearest neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of PseAA (pseudo amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set of candidates for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a query secretory protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm; (3) determining the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence alignment outcome for each of the aforementioned candidates through a voting system. Signal-3L is featured by high success prediction rates with short computational time, and hence is particularly useful for the analysis of large-scale datasets. Signal-3L is freely available as a web-server at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Signal-3L/ or http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Signal-3L, where, to further support the demand of the related areas, the signal peptides identified by Signal-3L for all the protein entries in Swiss-Prot databank that do not have signal peptide annotations or are annotated with uncertain terms but are classified by Signal-3L as secretory proteins are provided in a downloadable file. The large-scale file is prepared with Microsoft Excel and named "Tab-Signal-3L.xls", and will be updated once a year to include new protein entries and reflect the continuous development of Signal-3L.},

Two 5' terminal signal sequences derived from Toxoplasma gondii GRA8 protein and Plasmodium falciparum repetitive interspersed family protein, respectively, were confirmed to target YFP to the PVs of the transfected E. tenella, suggesting that signal sequences are functionally conserved among Apicomplexa. Three structurally different types of PVs were observed during the endogenous development of the transfected E. tenella in vitro.

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites are major pathogens of humans and domesticated animals. The ability of these organisms to evade the host immune response and the emergence of drug-resistant parasites indicates a need for the identification of novel control strategies. Ideally, selected targets should be shared by a range of apicomplexans and fundamental to parasite biology. One process of apicomplexan biology which may provide this type of target is the molecular regulation of stage differentiation. This paper has reviewed studies carried out on differentiation of Theileria annulata and has highlighted general similarities with other apicomplexan differentiation steps. Similarities include asynchrony of differentiation, the loss (attenuation) of differentiation potential and an association between reduced proliferation and differentiation. In addition, novel data are presented assessing a possible role for a signal transduction mechanism or a direct involvement of classical heat-shock polypeptides in regulating differentiation of T. annulata in vitro. These studies, and previously published data, have led to the postulation that progression to the next stage of the life-cycle can be predetermined and involves the attainment of a quantitative threshold by regulators of gene expression. A modification of this model takes into account that for certain in-vitro systems, or differentiation steps in vivo, the process has to be initiated by alteration of the extracellular environment. Work which has shown that the time taken to achieve differentiation can be increased or decreased is also outlined. The ability to change the timing of differentiation suggests that the associated regulatory mechanism could be manipulated directly to significantly influence the outcome of an apicomplexan infection. The observation that a number of existing drugs and control strategies may exert their protective effect by altering differentiation potential supports this possibility.},

   abstract = {To establish an experimental scale of hydrophobicities for the nucleic acid bases, comparable with a scale developed earlier for amino acid side-chains, these bases and their parent compounds (purine and pyrimidin-2-one) were converted to n-butylated and tetrahydrofurylated derivatives that are appreciably soluble in cyclohexane, a truly non-polar solvent that dissolves negligible water at saturation. Distribution measurements between neutral aqueous solution and cyclohexane, at varying solute concentrations, showed no evidence of self-association of the solute in either solvent, and the possibility of specific entrainment of water by solutes entering cyclohexane was ruled out by the results of experiments with tritiated water. In both the n-butyl and tetrahydrofuryl series, the bases span a range of approximately 5.3 kcal mol-1 in their free energies of transfer from water to cyclohexane, and are arranged in the following rank, in order of decreasing hydrophobicity: purine>thymine>adenine>uracil>pyrimidin-2-one>hypoxanthine>/=cytosine >/=guanine. In both series of pyrimidin-2-ones, hydrophobicity decreases with introduction of an amino substituent, but addition of an exocyclic keto group results in a modest enhancement of hydrophobicity; and free energies of transfer are relatively insensitive to the position of N-alkyl substitution. In both series of purines, hydrophobicity decreases with the introduction of exocyclic amino and keto groups, the keto group having the greater effect; and free energies of transfer vary substantially depending on the position of N-alkyl substitution. Several additional compounds were examined to test recent predictions based on SM5.4/A, a quantum mechanical self-consistent-field solvation model; and that model was found to yield values in reasonable agreement with the experimental results.},

The equilibrium constant for conversion of ES to ES*, in the oxygen exchange reaction, is less than 10-12. To investigate the structure of enzyme-bound inosine in a different way, we labeled deoxyinosine with 13C, excepting an upfield shift of 70-110 ppm if significant rehybridization to sp3 had occurred at the carbonyl group. Instead, the results show a very small shift (1.3 ppm), indicating that C-6 of 2'-deoxyinosine retains its sp2 hybridization after binding by calf intestinal adenosine deaminase. In a separate series of experiments, [4,5-13C]-2'-deoxyuridine was synthesized and found to retain its sp2 hybridization at C-4, after binding by Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase, an enzyme that catalyzes 18O exchange from water into uridine. These findings are consistent with the general expectation, based on the unfavorable equilibrium of activation of enzyme-bound substrates, that enzymes should not accumulate appreciable concentrations of intermediates whose free energies approach that of the transition state in substrate transformation.},

In a second study, birds treated with NP122 (identified as Bacillus subtilis) had significantly lower (P < 0.05) cecal ST than control and benefitted BW gain irrespective of the presence or absence of a Salmonella challenge. In conclusion, NP122 markedly reduced ST recovery and increased BW gain in both chicks and poults. This provides preliminary evidence that this isolate may have potential use as a DFM in poultry.},

The disease is multifactorial and is invariably associated with predisposing factors. In the present experiments, we investigated the potential predisposing role of neonatal Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) infection for NE-associated mortality in a laboratory challenge model. In two experiments, day-of-hatch chicks were randomly assigned to four groups: Group 1, nonchallenged control; Group 2, chickens received Eimeria maxima (EM) and CP; Group 3, chickens received EM and CP and were also challenged with ST at day 1 of age; Group 4, chickens received EM and CP and were also challenged with ST at day 17 of age. Challenged groups received an oral dose of EM at 18 days of age and CP (10(8) colony-forming units/chick) at 22-23 days of age. When compared to EM and CP, chicks challenged with ST (day 1) had increased NE-associated mortality and CP-associated lesion scores (P < 0.05) in both experiments. Furthermore, body weight and body weight gain were lower (P < 0.05) in chicks infected with ST (day 1) in the first experiment, even though no differences (P > 0.05) were observed in weight gain in the second experiment. Chicks challenged with ST (day 17) were similar to the EM and CP group in all of the above-mentioned parameters, indicating that a paratyphoid infection in younger chicks remarkably alters the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. Based on this work, the authors suggest that an ST infection early in the age of a chick may be important for altering susceptibility to NE, an observation that may be useful from the perspective of experimental reproduction of this disease and, perhaps, as an economically important reason to address the problem of paratyphoid Salmonella infections in young chicks.},

New details reveal mechanistic insight into the coordinated release and processing of adhesins, the complexity of adhesin-substrate interactions, the regulation of the actin-myosin motor complex, and the formation of a novel junction at the host-parasite interface.

   abstract = {Polyproline type II stretches are somewhat rare on proteins. The backbone of this secondary structural element folds to a triangular form instead of the normal alpha-helix with 3.6 residues per turn. It is a very challenging task to try to detect them computationally from protein sequence. Here, we have studied the preprocessing phase in particular, which is important for any machine learning method. Preprocessing included selection of relevant data from the Protein Data Bank and investigation of learnability properties. These properties show whether the material is suitable for neural network computing. The complexity of algorithms in connection with preprocessing was briefly considered. We found that feedforward perceptron neural networks were appropriate for the prediction of polyproline type II and also relatively efficient in this task. The problem is very difficult because of the great similarity of the two classes present in the classification. Nevertheless, neural networks were able to recognize and predict about 75% of secondary structures.},

   abstract = {To determine the effectiveness of the ribosome as a catalyst, we compared the rate of uncatalyzed peptide bond formation, by the reaction of the ethylene glycol ester of N-formylglycine with Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, with the rate of peptidyl transfer by the ribosome. Activation parameters were also determined for both reactions, from the temperature dependence of their second-order rate constants. In contrast with most protein enzymes, the enthalpy of activation is slightly less favorable on the ribosome than in solution. The 2 x 10(7)-fold rate enhancement produced by the ribosome is achieved entirely by lowering the entropy of activation. These results are consistent with the view that the ribosome enhances the rate of peptide bond formation mainly by positioning the substrates and/or water exclusion within the active site, rather than by conventional chemical catalysis.},

In addition, phthalimides 14 and 24 were incubated for 60 and 90h and an enhanced antimalarial effect was noticed with increase in time to great extent.

The combination of 24 with artemisinin (ART) showed enhanced killing of parasite against Pf3D7. Further, all phthalimides were evaluated for their activity against falcipain-2 (FP2), a major hemoglobinase of malarial parasite. The enzymatic assay afforded 6 as most active member against FP2.

   abstract = {An important goal of nanotechnology is the application of individual molecule handling techniques to the discovery of potential new therapeutic agents. Of particular interest is the search for new inhibitors of metabolic routes exclusive of human pathogens, such as the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway essential for the viability of most human pathogenic bacteria and of the malaria parasite. Using atomic force microscopy single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we have probed at the single-molecule level the interaction of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), which catalyzes the first step of the MEP pathway, with its two substrates, pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The data obtained in this pioneering SMFS analysis of a bisubstrate enzymatic reaction illustrate the substrate sequentiality in DXS activity and allow for the calculation of catalytic parameters with single-molecule resolution. The DXS inhibitor fluoropyruvate has been detected in our SMFS competition experiments at a concentration of 10 muM, improving by 2 orders of magnitude the sensitivity of conventional enzyme activity assays. The binding of DXS to pyruvate is a 2-step process with dissociation constants of k(off) = 6.1 x 10(-4) +/- 7.5 x 10(-3) and 1.3 x 10(-2) +/- 1.0 x 10(-2) s(-1), and reaction lengths of x(beta) = 3.98 +/- 0.33 and 0.52 +/- 0.23 A.

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites rely on a novel form of actin-based motility called gliding, which depends on parasite actin polymerization, to migrate through their hosts and invade cells. However, parasite actins are divergent both in sequence and function and only form short, unstable filaments in contrast to the stability of conventional actin filaments. The molecular basis for parasite actin filament instability and its relationship to gliding motility remain unresolved. We demonstrate that recombinant Toxoplasma (TgACTI) and Plasmodium (PfACTI and PfACTII) actins polymerized into very short filaments in vitro but were induced to form long, stable filaments by addition of equimolar levels of phalloidin. Parasite actins contain a conserved phalloidin-binding site as determined by molecular modeling and computational docking, yet vary in several residues that are predicted to impact filament stability. In particular, two residues were identified that form intermolecular contacts between different protomers in conventional actin filaments and these residues showed non-conservative differences in apicomplexan parasites. Substitution of divergent residues found in TgACTI with those from mammalian actin resulted in formation of longer, more stable filaments in vitro. Expression of these stabilized actins in T. gondii increased sensitivity to the actin-stabilizing compound jasplakinolide and disrupted normal gliding motility in the absence of treatment. These results identify the molecular basis for short, dynamic filaments in apicomplexan parasites and demonstrate that inherent instability of parasite actin filaments is a critical adaptation for gliding motility.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most enveloped viruses bud from infected cells by a process in which viral intracellular core components interact with cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane spike glycoproteins. We have demonstrated previously that a tyrosine motif in the cytoplasmic domain of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) spike glycoprotein E2 is absolutely essential for budding. In contrast, hardly anything is known regarding which region of the capsid protein is involved in spike binding. Therefore, the mechanism by which spikes are selectively sorted into the viral bud or by which energy is provided for envelopment, remains unclear. RESULTS: Molecular models of the SFV capsid protein (SFCP) and the cytoplasmic domain of the spike protein were fitted as a basis for a reverse genetics approach to characterizing the interaction between these two proteins. Biochemical analysis of mutants defined a hydrophobic pocket of the capsid protein that is involved both in spike binding and nucleocapsid assembly. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that aromatic residues in the capsid protein serve to bind the side chain of the essential E2 tyrosine providing both specificity for spike incorporation and energy for budding. The same hydrophobic pocket also appears to play a role in capsid assembly. Furthermore, the results suggest that budding may occur in the absence of preformed nucleocapsids. This is the first demonstration of the molecular mechanisms of spike-nucleocapsid interactions during virus budding.},

When the metal liganding residues Cys-129 and Cys-132 were replaced by Ala, and His-102 was replaced by Ala, Asn, or Gln, deaminase activities of cell extracts containing these mutant enzymes were decreased by several orders of magnitude relative to that of the wild-type enzyme. After purification, each mutant protein was found to contain less than 0.2 mol of zinc per enzyme subunit, except mutant H102Q, which contained 1 mol of zinc per subunit. The activity of each mutant enzyme increased in the presence of added zinc but never attained wild-type activity. Mutant H102N was unique in that this protein could be purified as a stable apoenzyme, activated by added zinc, and then inhibited by EDTA. This mutant enzyme bound zinc with an apparent Kd value of 6.0 x 10(-10) M and regained maximal activity in the presence of 1 mol of zinc per subunit. Affinities of the mutant cytidine deaminases for the transition-state analogue, 5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside (3,4) hydrate, were found to decrease in rough proportion to kcat/Km over a range spanning several orders of magnitude.

   abstract = {Cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are enzymes involved in transducing a vast number of signals in metazoans. The importance of the Tec family of kinases was immediately recognized when, in 1993, mutations in the gene encoding Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) were reported to cause the human disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Since then, additional kinases belonging to this family have been isolated, and the availability of full genome sequences allows identification of all members in selected species enabling phylogenetic considerations. Tec kinases are endowed with Pleckstrin homology (PH) and Tec homology (TH) domains and are involved in diverse biological processes related to the control of survival and differentiation fate. Membrane translocation resulting in the activation of Tec kinases with subsequent Ca2+ release seems to be a general feature. However, nuclear translocation may also be of importance. The purpose of this essay is to characterize members of the Tec family and discuss their involvement in signaling. The three-dimensional structure, expression pattern and evolutionary aspects will also be considered.},

   abstract = {To obtain a clearer understanding of the forces involved in transition state stabilization by Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase, we investigated the thermodynamic changes that accompany substrate binding in the ground state and transition state for substrate hydrolysis. Viscosity studies indicate that the action of cytidine deaminase is not diffusion-limited. Thus, K(m) appears to be a true dissociation constant, and k(cat) describes the chemical reaction of the ES complex, not product release. Enzyme-substrate association is accompanied by a loss of entropy and a somewhat greater release of enthalpy. As the ES complex proceeds to the transition state (ES), there is little further change in entropy, but heat is taken up that almost matches the heat that was released with ES formation. As a result, k(cat)/K(m) (describing the overall conversion of the free substrate to ES is almost invariant with changing temperature. The free energy barrier for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (k(cat)/K(m)) is much lower than that for the spontaneous reaction (k(non)) (DeltaDeltaG = -21.8 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C). This difference, which also describes the virtual binding affinity of the enzyme for the activated substrate in the transition state (S), is almost entirely enthalpic in origin (DeltaDeltaH = -20.2 kcal/mol), compatible with the formation of hydrogen bonds that stabilize the ES complex. Thus, the transition state affinity of cytidine deaminase increases rapidly with decreasing temperature. When a hydrogen bond between Glu-91 and the 3'-hydroxyl moiety of cytidine is disrupted by truncation of either group, k(cat)/K(m) and transition state affinity are each reduced by a factor of 10(4). This effect of mutation is entirely enthalpic in origin (DeltaDeltaH approximately 7.9 kcal/mol), somewhat offset by a favorable change in the entropy of transition state binding. This increase in entropy is attributed to a loss of constraints on the relative motions of the activated substrate within the ES complex. In an Appendix, some objections to the conventional scheme for transition state binding are discussed.},

E. coli cytidine deaminase enhances the rate of deamination of 5,6-dihydrocytidine (kcat/k(non) = 4.4 x 10(5)) by enhancing the entropy of activation (DeltaDeltaH# = 0 kcal/mol; TDeltaDeltaS# = +7.6 kcal/mol, at 25 degrees C). Binding of the competitive inhibitor 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine (THU), a stable analogue of 5,6-dihydrocytidine in the transition state for its deamination, is accompanied by a release of enthalpy (DeltaH = -7.1 kcal/mol, TDeltaDeltaS = +2.2 kcal/mol) that approaches the estimated enthalpy of binding of the actual substrate in the transition state for deamination of 5,6-dihydrocytidine (DeltaH = -8.1 kcal/mol, TDeltaDeltaS = +6.0 kcal/mol). Thus, the shortcomings of THU in capturing all of the binding affinity expected of an ideal transition-state analogue reflect a less favorable entropy of association. That difference may arise from the analogue's inability to displace a water molecule from the "leaving group site" at which ammonia is generated in the normal reaction. The effect on binding of removing the 4-OH group from the transition-state analogue THU, to form 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrozebularine (THZ) (DeltaDeltaH = -2.1 kcal/mol, TDeltaDeltaS = -4.4 kcal/mol), is mainly entropic, consistent with the inability of THZ to displace water from the "attacking group site". These results are consistent with earlier indications [Snider, M. J., and Wolfenden, R. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 11364] that site-bound water plays a prominent role in substrate activation and inhibitor binding by cytidine deaminase.},

   abstract = {15N isotope effects and solvent deuterium isotope effects have been measured for the hydrolytic deamination of cytidine catalyzed by Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase and for the uncatalyzed reaction proceeding spontaneously in neutral solution at elevated temperatures. The primary (15)(V/K) arising from the exocyclic amino group for wild-type cytidine deaminase acting on its natural substrate, cytidine, is 1.0109 (in H(2)O, pH 7.3), 1.0123 (in H(2)O, pH 4.2), and 1.0086 (in D(2)O, pD 7.3). Increasing solvent D(2)O content has no substantial effect on k(cat) but enhances k(cat)/K(m), with a proton inventory showing that the fractionation factors of at least two protons increase markedly during the reaction. Mutant cytidine deaminases with reduced catalytic activity show more pronounced (15)N isotope effects of 1.0124 (Glu91Ala), 1.0134 (His102Ala), and 1.0158 (His102Asn) at pH 7.3 in H(2)O, as expected for processes in which the chemical transformation of the substrate becomes more rate determining. The isotope effect of mutant His102Asn is 1.033 after correcting for protonation of the -NH(2) group, and represents the intrinsic isotope effect on C-N bond cleavage. This result allows an estimation of the forward commitment of the reaction with the wild-type enzyme. The observed (15)N kinetic isotope effect of the pyrimidine N-3, for wild-type cytidine deaminase acting on cytidine, is 0.9879, which is consistent with protonation and rehybidization of N-3 with hydroxide ion attack on the adjacent carbon to create a tetrahedral intermediate. These results show that enzymatic deamination of cytidine proceeds stepwise through a tetrahedral intermediate with ammonia elimination as the major rate-determining step. The primary (15)N isotope effects observed for the uncatalyzed reaction at pH 7 (1.0021) and pH 12.5 (1.0034) were found to be insensitive to changing temperatures between 100 and 185 degrees C. These results show that the uncatalyzed and the enzymatic deaminations of cytidine proceed by similar mechanisms, although the commitment to C-N bond breaking is greater for the spontaneous reaction.},

   abstract = {Kinetic measurements have shown that substantial enthalpy changes accompany substrate binding by cytidine deaminase, increasing markedly as the reaction proceeds from the ground state (1/K(m), DeltaH = -13 kcal/mol) to the transition state (1/K(tx), DeltaH = -20 kcal/mol) [Snider, M. J., et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 9746-9753]. In the present work, we determined the thermodynamic changes associated with the equilibrium binding of inhibitors by cytidine deaminase by isothermal titration calorimetry and van't Hoff analysis of the temperature dependence of their inhibition constants. The results indicate that the binding of the transition state analogue 3,4-dihydrouridine DeltaH = -21 kcal/mol), like that of the transition state itself (DeltaH = -20 kcal/mol), is associated with a large favorable change in enthalpy. The significantly smaller enthalpy change that accompanies the binding of 3,4-dihydrozebularine (DeltaH = -10 kcal/mol), an analogue of 3,4-dihydrouridine in which a hydrogen atom replaces this inhibitor's 4-OH group, is consistent with the view that polar interactions with the substrate at the site of its chemical transformation play a critical role in reducing the enthalpy of activation for substrate hydrolysis. The entropic shortcomings of 3,4-dihydrouridine, in capturing all of the free energy involved in binding the actual transition state, may arise from its inability to displace a water molecule that occupies the binding site normally occupied by product ammonia.},

   abstract = {Human malignant infantile osteopetrosis (arOP; MIM 259700) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder of bone metabolism, which, if untreated, has a fatal outcome. Our group, as well as others, have recently identified mutations in the ATP6i (TCIRG1) gene, encoding the a3 subunit of the vacuolar proton pump, which mediates the acidification of the bone/osteoclast interface, are responsible for a subset of this condition. By sequencing the ATP6i gene in arOP patients from 44 unrelated families with a worldwide distribution we have now established that ATP6i mutations are responsible for approximately 50% of patients affected by this disease. The vast majority of these mutations (40 out of 42 alleles, including seven deletions, two insertions, 10 nonsense substitutions and 21 mutations in splice sites) are predicted to cause severe abnormalities in the protein product and are likely to represent null alleles. In addition, we have also analysed nine unrelated arOP patients from Costa Rica, where this disease is apparently much more frequent than elsewhere. All nine Costa Rican patients bore either or both of two missense mutations (G405R and R444L) in amino acid residues which are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. The identification of ATP6i gene mutations in two families allowed us for the first time to perform prenatal diagnosis: both fetuses were predicted not to be affected and two healthy babies were born. This study contributes to the determination of genetic heterogeneity of arOP and allows further delineation of the other genetic defects causing this severe condition.},

The EST sequencing projects in Toxoplasma gondii and the Plasmodium falciparum genome sequencing project have greatly accelerated gene discovery, revealing for example novel coding sequences restricted to the Apicomplexa. However, easy acquisition of sequence is almost useless if the function of any given gene cannot be tested. The establishment of transfection systems in Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora and in several Plasmodium species has provided us with the reverse genetics methods appropriate to the functional analysis of genes. Over the past few years, the discovery of novel genes coupled to the ability to introduce or modify genes has already contributed to a better understanding of cell biology and pathogenesis of these obligate intracellular parasites. Some insights into the complex processes of parasite invasion, differentiation, regulation of gene expression and protein trafficking are emerging although identification of the exact functional roles for many molecules is still awaiting more investigation. This review summarizes progress in this area. It also emphasises the tight link and synergy between Toxoplasma and malaria research. The use of reverse genetics does not guarantee the answer to gene function, so we can learn from both failed and successful experiments about how better and more efficiently to use 'genomics' to accelerate discoveries relevant to the understanding of parasitism by Apicomplexa.},

METHODS: All patients referred for suspected CADR secondary to AM between 2001 and 2014 in eight French dermatology centers were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: We report herein a retrospective series of 20 patients with CADR and AM involvement. Skin tests, performed in 14/20 patients, were negative in all cases.

Mutations that inactivate this kinase were found in families with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). In this study the Btk gene was analyzed in 13 registered Greek patients with XLA phenotype originated from 12 unrelated families, in order to provide a definite diagnosis of the XLA. The structure of Btk was analyzed at the cDNA level using the recently developed method, NIRCA (Non-Isotopic-Rnase-Cleavage-Assay). Alterations were detected in all patients and sequencing analysis confirmed the results and defined six novel XLA-associated Btk mutations (three missense mutations: C337G, L346R, L452P; one nonsense mutation: Y392X, and two frameshift alterations: c1211-1212delA, c1306-1307insA). Having defined the genetic alteration in the affected males of these families, the information was used to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and the Btk segments containing the mutated sequences were amplified from peripheral blood derived genomic DNA of potential female carriers. The PCR products were directly sequenced and carrier status was determined in 12 out of 16 phenotypically normal females analyzed. This protocol can be used once the nature of the Btk mutation has been defined in one of the affected males and provides a convenient, simple and reliable way to determine the carrier status of other female family members. Molecular genetic analysis constitutes a determinative tool for the definitive diagnosis of XLA and may allow accurate carrier and prenatal diagnosis for genetic counselling.},

The intraerythrocytic parasite itself maintains a low cytosolic [Na(+)] via unknown mechanisms. Here we present evidence that the intraerythrocytic parasite actively extrudes Na(+) against an inward gradient via PfATP4, a parasite plasma membrane protein with sequence similarities to Na(+)-ATPases of lower eukaryotes. Mutations in PfATP4 confer resistance to a potent class of antimalarials, the spiroindolones. Consistent with this, the spiroindolones cause a profound disruption in parasite Na(+) homeostasis, which is attenuated in parasites bearing resistance-conferring mutations in PfATP4. The mutant parasites also show some impairment of Na(+) regulation. Taken together, our results are consistent with PfATP4 being a Na(+) efflux ATPase and a target of the spiroindolones.},

   abstract = {All reactions are accelerated by an increase in temperature, but the magnitude of that effect on very slow reactions does not seem to have been fully appreciated. The hydrolysis of polysaccharides, for example, is accelerated 190,000-fold when the temperature is raised from 25 to 100 degrees C, while the rate of hydrolysis of phosphate monoester dianions increases 10,300,000-fold. Moreover, the slowest reactions tend to be the most heat-sensitive. These tendencies collapse, by as many as five orders of magnitude, the time that would have been required for early chemical evolution in a warm environment. We propose, further, that if the catalytic effect of a "proto-enzyme"--like that of modern enzymes--were mainly enthalpic, then the resulting rate enhancement would have increased automatically as the environment became cooler. Several powerful nonenzymatic catalysts of very slow biological reactions, notably pyridoxal phosphate and the ceric ion, are shown to meet that criterion. Taken together, these findings greatly reduce the time that would have been required for early chemical evolution, countering the view that not enough time has passed for life to have evolved to its present level of complexity.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the rate enhancements produced by representative kinases and their thermodynamic basis, rate constants were determined as a function of changing temperature for 1) the spontaneous methanolysis of ATP and 2) reactions catalyzed by kinases to which different mechanisms of action have been ascribed. For each of these enzymes, the minor effects of changing viscosity indicate that k(cat)/K(m) is governed by the central chemical events in the enzyme-substrate complex rather than by enzyme-substrate encounter. Individual Arrhenius plots, obtained at intervals between pH 4.8 and 11.0, yielded Delta H(#) and T Delta S(#) for the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP(2-), ATP(3-), and ATP(4-) in the absence of Mg(2+). The addition of Mg(2+) led to partly compensating changes in Delta H(#) and T Delta S(#), accelerating the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP 11-fold at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. The rate enhancements produced by yeast hexokinase, homoserine kinase, and N-acetylgalactosamine kinase (obtained by comparison of their k(cat)/K(m) values in the presence of saturating phosphoryl acceptor with the second order rate constant for methanolysis of MgATP) ranged between 10(12)- and 10(14)-fold. Their nominal affinities for the altered substrates in the transition state were 2.1 x 10(-16) m for N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, 7.4 x 10(-17) m for homoserine kinase, and 6.4 x 10(-18) m for hexokinase. Compared with nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer, all three kinases were found to produce major reductions in the entropy of activation, in accord with the likelihood that substrate juxtaposition and desolvation play prominent roles in their catalytic action.},

We show complementation, gene cloning, and biological verification with a mutant parasite lacking hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and a T. gondii cDNA library. We also explored the utility of this approach to clone genes based on function from other apicomplexan parasites using Toxoplasma as a surrogate. A heterologous library containing Cryptosporidium parvum genomic DNA was generated, and we identified a C. parvum gene coding for inosine 5-monophosphate-dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis demonstrates a clear eubacterial origin of this gene and strongly suggests its lateral transfer from epsilon-proteobacteria. The prokaryotic origin of this enzyme might make it a promising target for therapeutics directed against Cryptosporidium.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cohort event monitoring (CEM) is an intensive method of post-marketing surveillance for medicines safety. The method is based on prescription event monitoring, which began in the 1970s, and has since been adapted by WHO for monitoring the safety of medicines used in Public Health Programmes. CEM aims to capture all adverse events that occur in a defined group of patients after starting treatment with a specific medicine during the course of routine clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to describe the experiences of National Pharmacovigilance Centres (NCs) that have used CEM to monitor artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated malaria in the African setting, to raise awareness of some of the challenges encountered during implementation and to highlight aspects of the method that require further consideration. METHOD: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to capture the experiences of NCs that have implemented CEM for active post-marketing surveillance of antimalarial medicines in sub-Saharan Africa. Six NCs were identified as having implemented CEM programmes and were invited to participate in the survey; five NCs indicated willingness to participate and were sent the questionnaire to complete. RESULTS: Four NCs responded to the survey-Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe-providing information on the implementation of a total of six CEM programmes. Their experiences indicate that CEM has helped to build pharmacovigilance capacity within the participating NCs and at the monitoring sites, and that healthcare providers (HCPs) are generally willing to participate in implementing the CEM method. All of the programmes took longer than expected to complete: contributing factors included a prolonged enrolment period and unexpectedly slow data entry. All of the programmes exceeded their budget by 11.1-63.2 %. Data management was identified as a challenge for all participating NCs. CONCLUSIONS: The reported experiences of four NCs that have undertaken CEM studies on ACTs indicate that CEM has helped to build pharmacovigilance capacity within NCs and monitoring sites and that HCPs are willing to participate in CEM programmes; however, the method was found to be labour intensive and data management was identified as a challenge. Reducing the workload associated with CEM, particularly in relation to data management, and integrating the method into the routine work of HCPs and NCs should be considered for future implementation.},

In principal, chemistry, and even biology, can be fully derived from non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In practice, conventional quantum chemical calculations are computationally too intensive and time consuming to be useful for drug discovery on more than a limited basis. A previously described, original, quantum-based computational process for drug discovery and design bridges this gap between theory and practice, and allows the application of quantum methods to large-scale in silico identification of active compounds. Here, we show the results of this quantum-similarity approach applied to the discovery of novel liver-stage antimalarials. Testing of only five of the model-predicted compounds in vitro and in vivo hepatic stage drug inhibition assays with P. berghei identified four novel chemical structures representing three separate quantum classes of liver-stage antimalarials. All four compounds inhibited liver-stage Plasmodium as a single oral dose in the quantitative PCR mouse liver-stage sporozoites-challenge model. One of the newly identified compounds, cethromycin [ABT-773], a macrolide-quinoline hybrid, is a drug with an extensive (over 5,000 people) safety profile warranting its exploitation as a new weapon for the current effort of malaria eradication. The results of our molecular modeling exceed current state-of-the-art computational methods. Drug discovery through quantum similarity is data-driven, agnostic to any particular target or disease process that can evaluate multiple phenotypic, target-specific, or co-crystal structural data. This allows the incorporation of additional pharmacological requirements, as well as rapid exploration of novel chemical spaces for therapeutic applications.},

In Toxoplasma gondii, global analysis of gene expression demonstrates that dynamic changes in mRNA levels unfold in a serial cascade during asexual replication and up to 50% of encoded genes are unequally expressed in development. Recent studies indicate transcription and mRNA processing have important roles in fulfilling the 'just-in-time' delivery of proteins to parasite growth and development. The prominence of post-transcriptional mechanisms in the Apicomplexa was demonstrated by mechanistic studies of the critical RNA-binding proteins and regulatory kinases. However, it is still early in our understanding of how transcription and post-transcriptional mechanisms are balanced to produce adequate numbers of specialized forms that is required to complete the parasite life cycle.},

To examine whether these putative signal peptides are functionally equivalent to signal peptides of secretory proteins, cDNA coding for a fusion protein was produced, in which the signal peptide for preproparathyroid hormone was replaced with the putative signal peptide of cytochrome P450IIC2. The translational product of RNA synthesized in vitro from the cDNA was neither processed nor translocated by chicken oviduct microsomal membranes in a reticulocyte cell-free system but was resistant to extraction from the membranes by alkaline solutions. In addition, the translation of the hybrid RNA was arrested by signal recognition particle. Unlike most signal peptides, the cytochrome P450IIC2 NH2-terminal sequence does not contain basic amino acids preceding the hydrophobic core. Introduction by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of lysine and arginine at the NH2 terminus resulted in a fusion protein that was partially processed by the microsomal membranes, with translocation across the membrane of both the processed and unprocessed proteins. The positive charges convert the cytochrome P450IIC2 NH2 terminus from a combination membrane insertion-halt transfer signal to a more classical secretory membrane-insertion signal, possibly by altering the orientation of the signal peptide in the membrane.

In 2012, this survey was repeated to allow a statistically valid analysis of change through time. The counterfeit detection device 3 (CD-3) was used to assess packaging quality in the field and HPLC and mass spectroscopy analysis chemical analysis performed. The availability of oral artesunate monotherapies had significantly decreased from 22.9% (22) of 96 outlets in southern Laos in 2003 to 4.8% (7) of 144 outlets in 2012 (P < 0.0001). All the samples collected in the 2012 survey contained the correct active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in contrast to the 21 (84%) falsified artesunate samples found in the 2003 survey. Although none of the medicines found in 2012 survey had evidence for falsification, 25.4% (37) of the samples were outside the 90-110% pharmacopeial limits of the label claim, suggesting that they were substandard or degraded. Results obtained from this survey show that patients are still exposed to poorly manufactured drugs or to ineffective medicines such as chloroquine. The quality of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) used in Laos needs to be monitored, since falsified ACTs would have devastating consequences in public health.},

Our results show that these molecules, after interaction of the endoperoxide bond with Fe(ii), likely coming from the heme molecule, give rise to the formation of an oxygen radical, followed by rearrangement to give a carbon radical centered on the "western" alkyl side-chain. The carbon radicals generated on the side-chain, amenable for intermolecular reactions, should represent the toxic intermediates responsible for subsequent reactions leading to plasmodium death. The minimal structural requirements necessary for the activity of this class of antimalarial agents have been identified and discussed throughout the paper.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance (IR) and obesity are common features of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Insulin-sensitizing agents have been shown to improve both reproductive and metabolic aspects of PCOS, but it remains unclear whether it is also beneficial in lean patients without pre-treatment IR. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of metformin on the clinical and biochemical parameters of PCOS irrespective of the presence of basal obesity and IR. DESIGN: The effect of 6 months of metformin treatment was prospectively assessed in 188 PCOS patients, divided into three groups according to body mass index (BMI; lean: BMI<25 kg/m2, overweight: BMI 25-29 kg/m2, and obese: BMI30 kg/m2). Outcome parameters, which were also assessed in 102 healthy controls, included body weight, homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose and insulin levels, area under the curve of insulin response (AUCI), hyperandrogenism, and menstrual irregularities. RESULTS: In comparison with the respective BMI-appropriate control groups, only obese but not lean and overweight PCOS patients showed differences in fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. Metformin therapy significantly improved all outcome parameters except fasting glucose levels. Subgroup analyses revealed that in the group of lean PCOS patients without pre-treatment IR, metformin significantly improved HOMA-IR (1.7+/-1.0 vs 1.1+/-0.7 micromol/lxmmol/l2) and fasting insulin levels (7.7+/-4.2 vs 5.4+/-3.9 mU/l), in addition to testosterone levels (2.6+/-0.9 vs 1.8+/-0.7 nmol/l), anovulation rate (2.3 vs 59.5%), and acne (31.8 vs 11.6%; all P<0.017). In the overweight and obese PCOS groups, metformin also showed the expected beneficial effects. CONCLUSION: Metformin improves parameters of IR, hyperandrogenemia, anovulation, and acne in PCOS irrespective of pre-treatment IR or obesity.},

LC-ESI-MS/MS methods were validated for simultaneous bioanalysis of lumefantrine and 99-411 and of piperaquine and 99-411 combinations. The interaction studies were performed in rats using these validated methods. The total systemic exposure of 99-411 increased when administered with either lumefantrine or piperaquine. However, co-administration of 99-411 significantly decreased the systemic exposure of piperaquine by half-fold while it had no effect on the kinetics of lumefantrine. 99-411, thus, seemed to be a good alternative to artemisinin derivatives for combination treatment with lumefantrine. To explore the reason for increased plasma levels of 99-411, an in situ permeability study was performed by co-perfusing lumefantrine and 99-411. In presence of lumefantrine, the absorption of 99-411 was significantly increased by 1.37 times than when given alone. Lumefantrine did not affect the metabolism of 99-411 when tested in vitro in human liver microsomes. Additionally, ATPase assay suggest that 99-411 was a substrate of human P-gp, thus, indicating the probability of interaction at the absorption level in humans as well.},

Modeling the dynamics of very large PPI networks is computationally costly. RESULTS: To circumvent this problem, we created a link-weighted human immunome interactome and performed filtering. We reconstructed the immunome interactome and weighed the links using jackknife gene expression correlation of integrated, time course gene expression data. Statistical significance of the links was computed using the Global Statistical Significance (GloSS) filtering algorithm. P-values from GloSS were computed for the integrated, time course gene expression data. We filtered the immunome interactome to identify core components of the T cell PPI network (TPPIN). The interconnectedness of the major pathways for T cell survival and response, including the T cell receptor, MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways, are maintained in the TPPIN network. The obtained TPPIN network is supported both by Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis along with study of essential genes enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating gene expression data to the immunome interactome and using a weighted network filtering method, we identified the T cell PPI immune response network. This network reveals the most central and crucial network in T cells. The approach is general and applicable to any dataset that contains sufficient information.},

   abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites contain a vestigial plastid called apicoplast which has been suggested to be a site of [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis. Here we report the cloning of lipoic acid synthase (LipA) from Toxoplasma gondii, a well known [Fe-S] protein. It is able to complement a LipA-deficient Escherichia coli strain, clearly demonstrating that the parasite protein is a functional LipA. The N-terminus of T. gondii LipA is unusual with respect to an internal signal peptide preceding an apicoplast targeting domain. Nevertheless, it efficiently targets a reporter protein to the apicoplast of T. gondii whereas co-localization with the fluorescently labeled mitochondrion was not detected. In silico analysis of several apicomplexan genomes indicates that the parasites, in addition to the presumably apicoplast-resident pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, contain three other mitochondrion-localized target proteins for lipoic acid attachment. We also identified single genes for lipoyl (octanoyl)-acyl carrier protein:protein transferase (LipB) and lipoate protein ligase (LplA) in these genomes. It thus appears that unlike plants, which have only two LipA and LipB isoenzymes in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria, Apicomplexa seem to use the second known lipoylating activity, LplA, for lipoylation in their mitochondrion.},

The number of SNPs identified in the human genome is growing rapidly, but attaining experimental knowledge about the possible disease association of variants is laborious and time-consuming. Several computational methods have been developed for the classification of SNPs according to their predicted pathogenicity. In this study, we have evaluated the performance of nine widely used pathogenicity prediction methods available on the Internet. The evaluated methods were MutPred, nsSNPAnalyzer, Panther, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen, PolyPhen2, SIFT, SNAP, and SNPs&GO. The methods were tested with a set of over 40,000 pathogenic and neutral variants. We also assessed whether the type of original or substituting amino acid residue, the structural class of the protein, or the structural environment of the amino acid substitution, had an effect on the prediction performance. The performances of the programs ranged from poor (MCC 0.19) to reasonably good (MCC 0.65), and the results from the programs correlated poorly. The overall best performing methods in this study were SNPs&GO and MutPred, with accuracies reaching 0.82 and 0.81, respectively.},

   abstract = {Cyclic and congenital neutropenia are caused by mutations in the human neutrophil elastase (HNE) gene (ELA2), leading to an immunodeficiency characterized by decreased or oscillating levels of neutrophils in the blood. The HNE mutations presumably cause loss of enzyme activity, consequently leading to compromised immune system function. To understand the structural basis for the disease, we implemented methods from bioinformatics to analyze all the known HNE missense mutations at both the sequence and structural level. Our results demonstrate that the 32 different mutations have diverse effects on HNE structure and function, affecting structural disorder and aggregation tendencies, stability maintaining contacts, and electrostatic properties. A large proportion of the mutations are located at conserved amino acids, which are usually essential in determining protein structure and function. The majority of the disease-causing HNE missense mutations lead to major structural changes and loss of stability in the protein. A few mutations also affect functional residues, leading into decreased catalytic activity or altered ligand binding. Our analysis reveals the putative effects of all known missense mutations in HNE, thus allowing the structural basis of cyclic and congenital neutropenia to be elucidated. We have employed and analyzed a set of some 30 different methods for predicting the effects of amino acid substitutions. We present results and experience from the analysis of the applicability of these methods in the analysis of numerous genes, proteins, and diseases to reveal protein structure-function relationships and disease genotype-phenotype correlations.},

It is caused by mutations of CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154), expressed on T-lymphocytes. The interaction of CD40L on T-cells and its receptor CD40 on B-cells is essential for lymphocyte signalling leading to immunoglobulin class switching and B-cell maturation. To understand the structural basis for XHIGM, we utilised bioinformatics methods to analyse all the known CD40L missense mutations at both the sequence and structural level. Our results demonstrate that the 35 different missense mutations have diverse effects on CD40L structure and function, affecting structural disorder and aggregation tendencies, stability maintaining contacts and electrostatic properties. Several mutations also affect residues essential in receptor binding and trimerisation. Experimental study of effects of mutations is laborious and time-consuming and at the structural level often almost impossible. By contrast, precise and useful information about effects of mutations on protein structure and function can readily be obtained by theoretical methods. In this study, all the XHIGM causing missense mutations could be explained in terms of CD40L structure and function. Thus, the molecular basis of the syndrome could be elucidated.},

   abstract = {Many gene defects are relatively easy to identify experimentally, but obtaining information about the effects of sequence variations and elucidation of the detailed molecular mechanisms of genetic diseases will be among the next major efforts in mutation research. Amino acid substitutions may have diverse effects on protein structure and function; thus, a detailed analysis of the mutations is essential. Experimental study of the molecular effects of mutations is laborious, whereas useful and reliable information about the effects of amino acid substitutions can readily be obtained by theoretical methods. Experimentally defined structures and molecular modeling can be used as a basis for interpretation of the mutations. The effects of missense mutations can be analyzed even when the 3D structure of the protein has not been determined, although structure-based analyses are more reliable. Structural analyses include studies of the contacts between residues, their implication for the stability of the protein, and the effects of the introduced residues. Investigations of steric and stereochemical consequences of substitutions provide insights on the molecular fit of the introduced residue. Mutations that change the electrostatic surface potential of a protein have wide-ranging effects. Analyses of the effects of mutations on interactions with ligands and partners have been performed for elucidation of functional mutations. We have employed numerous methods for predicting the effects of amino acid substitutions. We discuss the applicability of these methods in the analysis of genes, proteins, and diseases to reveal protein structure-function relationships, which is essential to gain insights into disease genotype-phenotype correlations.},

Initial lab tests showed mildly elevated serum sodium levels and low urine osmolality. Under water deprivation, diuresis and low urine osmolality persisted and serum sodium levels rose above 150 mmol/l. Oral desmopressin resulted in normalisation of serum sodium as well as urine osmolarity, confirming a diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus. As drug-induced diabetes could be excluded, pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. A demyelinating lesion was detected in the hypothalamus. The patient was started on oral desmopressin treatment (0.2 mg/day). Fluid intake and serum sodium levels have since remained normal. In summary, we report the rare case of a patient presenting with diabetes insipidus due to progressive MS. Diabetes insipidus should be considered in MS patients who develop new onset of polydipsia.},

   abstract = {Although protein coding genes occupy only a small fraction of genomes in higher species, they are not randomly distributed within or between chromosomes. Clustering of genes with related function(s) and/or characteristics has been evident at several different levels. To study how common the clustering of functionally related genes is and what kind of functions the end products of these genes are involved, we collected gene ontology (GO) terms for complete genomes and developed a method to detect previously undefined gene clustering. Exhaustive analysis was performed for seven widely studied species ranging from human to Escherichia coli. To overcome problems related to varying gene lengths and densities, a novel method was developed and a fixed number of genes were analyzed irrespective of the genome span covered. Statistically very significant GO term clustering was apparent in all the investigated genomes. The analysis window, which ranged from 5 to 50 consecutive genes, revealed extensive GO term clusters for genes with widely varying functions. Here, the most interesting and significant results are discussed and the complete dataset for each analyzed species is available at the GOme database at http://bioinf.uta.fi/GOme. The results indicated that clusters of genes with related functions are very common, not only in bacteria, in which operons are frequent, but also in all the studied species irrespective of how complex they are. There are some differences between species but in all of them GO term clusters are common and of widely differing sizes. The presented method can be applied to analyze any genome or part of a genome for which descriptive features are available, and thus is not restricted to ontology terms. This method can also be applied to investigate gene and protein expression patterns. The results pave a way for further studies of mechanisms that shape genome structure and evolutionary forces related to them.},

Among these are the hemogregarines, which include some of the most common hemoparasites found in reptiles. Several studies have reported a possible pattern of prey-predator transmission for some of these parasites. Snakes from the Mediterranean region have been found to be parasitized with Hepatozoon spp. similar to those in lacertids and gekkonids, supporting the prey-predator transmission hypothesis. Here we analyzed specimens of the saurophagous genus Psammophis from North Africa, an ecologically different region. Through molecular analysis of tissue samples we detected 3 different apicomplexan parasites: Caryospora, Sarcocystis, and Hepatozoon. Caryospora was detected in a Forskal's sand snake Psammophis schokari from Algeria, constituting the first time these parasites have been detected from a tissue sample through molecular screening. The obtained Sarcocystis phylogeny does not reflect the relationships of their final hosts, with the parasites identified from snakes forming at least 3 unrelated groups, indicating that it is still premature to predict definitive host based on the phylogeny of these parasites. Three unrelated lineages of Hepatozoon parasites were identified in Psammophis, each closely related to lineages previously identified from different lizard groups, on which these snakes feed. This once again indicates that diet might be a key element in transmission, at least for Hepatozoon species of saurophagous snakes.},

Utilizing agricultural biomass for the production of biofuel has drawn much interest in many science and engineering disciplines. As one of the major crops, maize offers promise in this regard. Compared to other crops with biofuel potential, maize can provide both starch (seed) and cellulosic (stover) material for bioethanol production. However, the combination of food, feed and fuel in one crop, although appealing, raises concerns related to the land delineation and distribution of maize grown for energy versus food and feed. To avoid this dilemma, the conversion of maize biomass into bioethanol must be improved. Conventional breeding, molecular marker assisted breeding and genetic engineering have already had, and will continue to have, important roles in maize improvement. The rapidly expanding information from genomics and genetics combined with improved genetic engineering technologies offer a wide range of possibilities for enhanced bioethanol production from maize.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antimalarials (AMs) have been demonstrated to reduce disease activity and prevent damage accrual in SLE. Recent guidelines advise prescribing AMs in all patients with SLE. We present data from the Amsterdam Lupus Cohort on use, reasons for non-use, and dosage related intolerance of AMs, as well as disease related variables associated with non-use. METHODS: AM use was assessed in all our SLE patients included in a longitudinal cohort study. Demographic and disease characteristics were compared between users and non-users of AMs. Daily dosages of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) according to lean body weight were calculated. RESULTS: Out of 190 SLE patients in the cohort, 139 (73.2%) were using AMs during their last visit, predominantly HCQ (136/139, 97.8%), while 92.1% (175/190) had ever used AMs. Daily dosage of HCQ was 400 mg in 115/136 (84.6%) patients. According to lean body weight, 119/136 (87.5%) had daily dosages of HCQ above the recommended 6.5 mg/kg. Patients did not use AMs (n=51) for the following reasons: intolerance (n=16), discontinued without a documented reason (n=11), never initiated (n=9), quiescent disease (n=7), contraindication (n=2), other (n=6). Only one patient discontinued HCQ due to AM-related retinopathy. Non-use of AMs was associated with a longer disease duration, higher damage accrual and a history of lupus nephritis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased awareness of the importance of AM treatment in SLE, there is still room for improvement, especially in patients with lupus nephritis and/or long-standing disease. Daily dosages of hydroxychloroquine often exceeded recommendations from guidelines, but are generally well-tolerated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between antimalarials (AM) and elevated muscle enzymes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PATIENTSMETHODS: 325 lupus patients with abnormal creatine phosphokinase (CPK) for at least two consecutive clinic visits were enrolled; 54 patients on statins/fibrates (n = 43) and/or active myositis (n = 14) were excluded. The control group consisted of 1453 lupus patients with no CPK elevation during follow-up. Descriptive statistics and Cox regression analyses were performed, p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Cases and controls did not differ regarding age at SLE diagnosis, gender ratio, or disease duration. AM use was more frequent in cases, which had more prolonged AM use. Total frequency of elevated CPK in AM users was 216/1322 (16.3%). Chloroquine was associated with a 3.3-fold, and hydroxychloroquine with a 3.1-fold, increased risk for CPK elevation. Black race was associated with higher CPK (HR = 2.941), whereas female gender was protective (HR = 0.697). 203 patients were followed for 7.3 +/- 5.6 years; 49.8% had persistent and 14.8% intermittent CPK elevation, while in 35.4% CPK was normalized. Clinical proximal muscle weakness developed in 5/203 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic AM use is a potential risk factor for muscle enzyme elevation in SLE patients. CPK abnormalities persist in almost two thirds of the patients, but this remains mainly a biochemical finding, evolving to clinical myopathy in about 2.5%.},

   abstract = {1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3) had earlier been regarded as the only active hormone. The newly identified actions of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24R,25(OH)2D3) broadened the vitamin D3 endocrine system, however, the current data are fragmented and a systematic understanding is lacking. Here we performed the first systematic study of global gene expression to clarify their similarities and differences. Three metabolites at physiologically comparable levels were utilized to treat human and mouse fibroblasts prior to DNA microarray analyses. Human primary prostate stromal P29SN cells (hP29SN), which convert 25(OH)D3 into 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 by 1alpha-hydroxylase (encoded by the gene CYP27B1), displayed regulation of 164, 171, and 175 genes by treatment with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D3, and 24R,25(OH)2D3, respectively. Mouse primary Cyp27b1 knockout fibroblasts (mCyp27b1 (-/-)), which lack 1alpha-hydroxylation, displayed regulation of 619, 469, and 66 genes using the same respective treatments. The number of shared genes regulated by two metabolites is much lower in hP29SN than in mCyp27b1 (-/-). By using DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray Analysis tools and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, we identified the agonistic regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling between 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 and unique non-classical actions of each metabolite in physiological and pathological processes, including cell cycle, keratinocyte differentiation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis signaling, gene transcription, immunomodulation, epigenetics, cell differentiation, and membrane protein expression. In conclusion, there are three distinct vitamin D3 hormones with clearly different biological activities. This study presents a new conceptual insight into the vitamin D3 endocrine system, which may guide the strategic use of vitamin D3 in disease prevention and treatment.},

   abstract = {Current malaria therapeutics demands strategies able to selectively deliver drugs to Plasmodium-infected red blood cells (pRBCs) in order to limit the appearance of parasite resistance. Here, the poly(amidoamines) AGMA1 and ISA23 have been explored for the delivery of antimalarial drugs to pRBCs. AGMA1 has antimalarial activity per se as shown by its inhibition of the in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum, with an IC(5)(0) of 13.7 muM. Fluorescence-assisted cell sorting data and confocal fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images indicate that both polymers exhibit preferential binding to and internalization into pRBCs versus RBCs, and subcellular targeting to the parasite itself in widely diverging species such as P. falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii, infecting humans and mice, respectively. AGMA1 and ISA23 polymers with hydrodynamic radii around 7 nm show a high loading capacity for the antimalarial drugs primaquine and chloroquine, with the final conjugate containing from 14.2% to 32.9% (w/w) active principle. Intraperitoneal administration of 0.8 mg/kg chloroquine as either AGMA1 or ISA23 salts cured P. yoelii-infected mice, whereas control animals treated with twice as much free drug did not survive. These polymers combining into a single chemical structure drug carrying capacity, low unspecific toxicity, high biodegradability and selective internalization into pRBCs, but not in healthy erythrocytes for human and rodent malarias, may be regarded as promising candidates deserving to enter the antimalarial therapeutic arena.},

   abstract = {The quest for new antimalarial drugs, especially those with novel modes of action, is essential in the face of emerging drug-resistant parasites. Here we describe a new chemical class of molecules, pyrazoleamides, with potent activity against human malaria parasites and showing remarkably rapid parasite clearance in an in vivo model. Investigations involving pyrazoleamide-resistant parasites, whole-genome sequencing and gene transfers reveal that mutations in two proteins, a calcium-dependent protein kinase (PfCDPK5) and a P-type cation-ATPase (PfATP4), are necessary to impart full resistance to these compounds. A pyrazoleamide compound causes a rapid disruption of Na(+) regulation in blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Similar effect on Na(+) homeostasis was recently reported for spiroindolones, which are antimalarials of a chemical class quite distinct from pyrazoleamides. Our results reveal that disruption of Na(+) homeostasis in malaria parasites is a promising mode of antimalarial action mediated by at least two distinct chemical classes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although biomedical information is growing rapidly, it is difficult to find and retrieve validated data especially for rare hereditary diseases. There is an increased need for services capable of integrating and validating information as well as proving it in a logically organized structure. A XML-based language enables creation of open source databases for storage, maintenance and delivery for different platforms. METHODS: Here we present a new data model called fact file and an XML-based specification Inherited Disease Markup Language (IDML), that were developed to facilitate disease information integration, storage and exchange. The data model was applied to primary immunodeficiencies, but it can be used for any hereditary disease. Fact files integrate biomedical, genetic and clinical information related to hereditary diseases. RESULTS: IDML and fact files were used to build a comprehensive Web and WAP accessible knowledge base ImmunoDeficiency Resource (IDR) available at http://bioinf.uta.fi/idr/. A fact file is a user oriented user interface, which serves as a starting point to explore information on hereditary diseases. CONCLUSION: The IDML enables the seamless integration and presentation of genetic and disease information resources in the Internet. IDML can be used to build information services for all kinds of inherited diseases. The open source specification and related programs are available at http://bioinf.uta.fi/idml/.},

XLA patients have a decreased number of mature B cells and a lack of all immunoglobulin isotypes, resulting in susceptibility to severe bacterial infections. XLA-causing mutations are collected in a mutation database (BTKbase), which is available at http://bioinf.uta.fi/BTKbase. For each patient the following information is given (when available): the identification of the entry, a plain English description of the mutation followed by a reference, formal characterization of the mutation, and the various parameters from the patient. BTKbase is implemented with the MUTbase program suite, which provides an easy, interactive, and quality controlled submission of information to mutation databases. BTKbase version 8 lists mutation entries of 1,111 patients from 973 unrelated families showing 602 unique molecular events. The localization of the mutations on the gene and protein for BTK can be analyzed by clicking sequences on the web pages. The distribution of the mutations in the five structural domains is approximately proportional to the length of the domains, except for the Tec homology (TH) domain. The most frequently affected sites are CpG dinucleotides. The majority of the missense mutations are structural-disturbing Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) folding or decreasing stability. Many of the mutations affect functionally significant, conserved residues. The structural consequences of the mutations in all the domains have been studied based on crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures as well as computer-aided molecular modeling.},

   abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: Heme is an essential prosthetic group for most life on Earth. It functions in numerous cellular redox reactions, including in antioxidant defenses and at several stages of the electron transport chain in prokaryotes and eukaryotic mitochondria. Heme also functions as a sensor and transport molecule for gases such as oxygen. Heme is a complex organic molecule and can only be synthesized through a multienzyme pathway from simpler precursors. Most free-living organisms synthesize their own heme by a broadly conserved metabolic pathway. Parasites are adept at scavenging molecules from their hosts, and heme is no exception. RECENT ADVANCES: In this review we examine recent advances in understanding heme usage and acquisition in Apicomplexa, a group of parasites that include the causative agents of malaria, toxoplasmosis, and several major parasites of livestock. CRITICAL ISSUES: Heme is critical to the survival of Apicomplexa, although the functions of heme in these organisms remain poorly understood. Some Apicomplexa likely scavenge heme from their host organisms, while others retain the ability to synthesize heme. Surprisingly, some Apicomplexa may be able to both synthesize and scavenge heme. Several Apicomplexa live in intracellular environments that contain high levels of heme. Since heme is toxic at high concentrations, parasites must carefully regulate intracellular heme levels and develop mechanisms to detoxify excess heme. Indeed, drugs interfering with heme detoxification serve as major antimalarials. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Understanding heme requirements and regulation in apicomplexan parasites promises to reveal multiple targets for much-needed therapeutic intervention against these parasites.},

This is verified by flexibility indices, which are derived from normalized B-values of individual amino acids in several refined three-dimensional structures. Flexibility indices show that overall flexibility is reduced when thermostability is increased. Protein molecules require both flexibility and rigidity to function, but the higher the temperature optimum and stability the more rigid is the structure needed to compensate for increased thermal fluctuations. Flexibilities of proteins performing the same catalytic activity seem to be about the same at their temperature optima, but the more rigid thermostable proteins reach the flexibility of thermolabile proteins at higher temperatures. In several proteins such as allosteric enzymes, some local sites of flexibility are highly conserved. The relevance of reduced flexibility to overall stability of proteins is also discussed. Flexibility indices and profiles can be used in the design of more stable proteins by site-directed mutagenesis.},

   abstract = {The three dimensional structures of human prostate specific antigen (PSA) and glandular kallikrein (hGK) were modeled based on porcine pancreatic kallikrein A. High sequence similarity and conserved framework of serine proteases enabled accurate modeling. The catalytic site region consisting of catalytic triad, residues forming oxyanion hole and main-chain substrate binding residues were conserved. The substrate specificity pocket of PSA resembles that of chymotrypsin and hGK is most related with tonin. The models were used to predict interactions with substrate and inhibitor molecules. The models are valuable in interpreting mutant and epitope mapping data as well as when modifying properties of the proteases or when developing diagnostic detection methods for prostatic cancer.},

This will enable readers to gain the full picture of technical information, performance, and interpretation of results, and to facilitate comparisons of related methods. Here, we provide instructions on how to describe new methods, report datasets, and assess the performance of predictive tools. We also discuss what details of predictor implementation are essential for authors to understand. Similarly, these guidelines for the use of predictors provide instructions on what needs to be delineated in the text, as well as how researchers can avoid unwarranted conclusions. They are applicable to most prediction methods currently utilized. By applying these guidelines, authors will help reviewers, editors, and readers to more fully comprehend prediction methods and their use.},

The applications include incomplete reporting of methods, especially about the use of prediction tools; method selection on unscientific grounds and without consulting independent method performance assessments; extending application area of methods outside their intended purpose; use of the same data several times for obtaining majority vote; and filtering of datasets so that variants of interest are excluded.

Several ontologies have been used to annotate numerous databases in biology and medicine. Due to their unambiguous nature, ontological annotations facilitate systematic description and data organization, data integration and mining, and pattern recognition and statistics, as well as development of analysis and prediction tools. The Variation Ontology (VariO) was developed to allow the annotation of effects, consequences, and mechanisms of DNA, RNA, and protein variations. Variation types are systematically organized, and a detailed description of effects and mechanisms is possible. VariO is for annotating the variant, not the normal-state features or properties, and requires a reference (e.g., reference sequence, reference-state property, activity, etc.) compared to which the changes are indicated. VariO is versatile and can be used for variations ranging from genomic multiplications to single nucleotide or amino acid changes, whether of genetic or nongenetic origin. VariO annotations are position-specific and can be used for variations in any organism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systematic representation of information related to genetic and non-genetic variations is required to allow large scale studies, data mining and data integration, and to make it possible to reveal novel relationships between genotype and phenotype. Although lots of variation data is available it is often difficult to use due to lack of systematics. RESULTS: A novel ontology, Variation Ontology (VariO http://variationontology.org), was developed for annotation of effects, consequences and mechanisms of variations. In this article instructions are provided on how VariO annotations are made. The major levels for description are the three molecules, namely DNA, RNA and protein. They are further divided to four major sublevels: variation type, function, structure, and property, and further up to eight sublevels. VariO annotation summarizes existing knowledge about a variation and its effects and formalizes it so that computational analyses are efficient. The annotations should be made on as many levels as possible. VariO annotations are made in reference to normal states, which vary for each data item including e.g. reference sequences, wild type properties, and activities. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed instructions together with examples are provided to indicate how VariO can be used for annotation of variations and their effects. A dedicated tool has been developed for annotation and will be further developed to cover also evidence for the annotations. VariO is suitable for annotation of data in many types of databases. As several different kinds of databases are in a process of adapting VariO annotations it is important to have guidelines to guarantee consistent annotation.},

   abstract = {Primary immunodeficiencies are intrinsic defects of immune systems. Mutations in a large number of cellular functions can lead to impaired immune responses. More than 80 primary immunodeficiencies are known to date. During the last years genes for several of these disorders have been identified. Here, mutation information for 23 genes affected in 14 immunodefects is presented. The proteins produced are employed in widely diverse functions, such as signal transduction, cell surface receptors, nucleotide metabolism, gene diversification, transcription factors, and phagocytosis. Altogether, the genetic defect of 2,140 families has been determined. Diseases with X-chromosomal origin constitute about 70% of all the cases, presumably due to full penetrance and because the single affected allele causes the phenotype. All types of mutations have been identified; missense mutations are the most common mutation type, and truncation is the most common effect on the protein level. Mutational hotspots in many disorders appear in CPG dinucleotides. The mutation data for the majority of diseases are distributed on the Internet with a special database management system, MUTbase. Despite large numbers of mutations, it has not been possible to make genotype-phenotype correlations for many of the diseases.},

This information is widely scattered and, for a newcomer, it would be difficult to obtain the latest information and guidance. Here, a sequence of steps essential for establishing an LSDB is discussed together with guidelines for each step. Curators need to collect information from various sources, code it in systematic way, and distribute to the research and clinical communities. In doing this, ethical issues have to be taken into account. To facilitate integration of information to, for example, analyze genotype-phenotype correlations, systematic data representation using established nomenclatures, data models, and ontologies is essential. LSDB curation and maintenance comprises a number of tasks that can be managed by following logical steps. These resources are becoming ever more important and new curators are essential to ensure that we will have expertly curated databases for all disease-related genes in the near future.},

This information is widely scattered and, for a newcomer, it would be difficult to obtain the latest information and guidance. Here, a sequence of steps essential for establishing an LSDB is discussed together with guidelines for each step. Curators need to collect information from various sources, code it in systematic way, and distribute to the research and clinical communities. In doing this, ethical issues have to be taken into account. To facilitate integration of information to, for example, analyze genotype-phenotype correlations, systematic data representation using established nomenclatures, data models, and ontologies is essential. LSDB curation and maintenance comprises a number of tasks that can be managed by following logical steps. These resources are becoming ever more important and new curators are essential to ensure that we will have expertly curated databases for all disease-related genes in the near future.},

These enzymes include alpha-amylase, beta-amylase, glucoamylase, alpha-glucosidase, pullulan-degrading enzymes, exoacting enzymes yielding alpha-type endproducts, and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase. Properties of these enzymes vary and are somewhat linked to the environmental circumstances of the producing organisms. Features of the enzymes, their action patterns, physicochemical properties, occurrence, genetics, and results obtained from cloning of the genes are described. Among all the amylolytic enzymes, the genetics of alpha-amylase in Bacillus subtilis are best known. Alpha-Amylase production in B. subtilis is regulated by several genetic elements, many of which have synergistic effects. Genes encoding enzymes from all the amylolytic enzyme groups dealt with here have been cloned, and the sequences have been found to contain some highly conserved regions thought to be essential for their action and/or structure. Glucoamylase appears usually in several forms, which seem to be the results of a variety of mechanisms, including heterogeneous glycosylation, limited proteolysis, multiple modes of mRNA splicing, and the presence of several structural genes.},

Conservative mutation of the conserved Arg-232 by Lys, for which no function has yet been proposed, resulted in lowered specific activity: around 12% of the parental enzyme. This mutant enzyme had a wider pH range but about the same temperature optimum and thermal stability as the wild-type enzyme.

The longer the truncation, the lower the specific activity of the enzyme. Only the two longest mutant proteins were active: the specific activity of the 498 residue variant was 97% and protein 483 was 36% that of the parental enzyme. The Km values of starch hydrolysis changed from 1.09 for wild type enzyme to 0.35 and 0.21 for mutants 498 and 483, respectively, indicating altered substrate binding. The mutant enzymes had almost identical pH and temperature optima with the wild type amylase, but enhanced thermal stability and altered end product profile. The consequences of the truncation to the structure and function of the enzymes were explored with molecular modeling. The liquefying amylases seem to require approximately 480 residues to be active, whereas the C-terminal end of B.stearothermophilus amylase is required for increased activity.},

The hydropathy propensities of amino acids were normalised to make the different scales and predictions comparable. Another program package can be used to study similarity on the secondary structural level by comparing, for example, hydropathy predictions. These methods can provide valuable information also when there is only low sequence similarity. Amino acid residue accessibilities can be shown for known three-dimensional structures in addition to predictions. The programs can further be used for searching for a suitable prediction method and window size for a group of related proteins when the structure of at least one representative is known.},

   abstract = {Protein structural flexibility is important for catalysis, binding, and allostery. Flexibility has been predicted from amino acid sequence with a sliding window averaging technique and applied primarily to epitope search. New prediction parameters were derived from 92 refined protein structures in an unbiased selection of the Protein Data Bank by developing further the method of Karplus and Schulz (Naturwissenschaften 72:212-213, 1985). The accuracy of four flexibility prediction techniques was studied by comparing atomic temperature factors of known three-dimensional protein structures to predictions by using correlation coefficients. The size of the prediction window was optimized for each method. Predictions made with our new parameters, using an optimized window size of 9 residues in the prediction window, were giving the best results. The difference from another previously used technique was small, whereas two other methods were much poorer. Applicability of the predictions was also tested by searching for known epitopes from amino acid sequences. The best techniques predicted correctly 20 of 31 continuous epitopes in seven proteins. Flexibility parameters have previously been used for calculating protein average flexibility indices which are inversely correlated to protein stability. Indices with the new parameters showed better correlation to protein stability than those used previously; furthermore they had relationship even when the old parameters failed.},

Characterization of the cellular and molecular bases of SCID is essential to provide accurate genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis, and it may offer the grounds for alternative forms of treatment. The Jak3 gene is mutated in most cases of autosomal recessive T(-)B(+) SCID in humans. Jak3 belongs to the family of intracellular Janus tyrosine kinases. It is physically and functionally coupled to the common gamma chain, gammac, shared by several cytokine receptors. We have established the JAK3base registry for disease and mutation information. In order to study the structural consequences of the Jak3 mutations, the structure of the human Jak3 kinase and pseudokinase domains was modeled. Residues involved in ATP and Mg(2+) binding were highly conserved in the kinase domain whereas the substrate binding region is somewhat different compared to other kinases. We have identified the first naturally occurring mutations disrupting the function of the human Jak3 kinase domain. The structural basis of all of the known Jak3 mutations reported so far is discussed based on the modeled structure. The model of the Jak3 protein also permits us to study Jak3 phosphorylation at the structural level and may thus serve in the design of novel immune suppressive drugs.},

Btk is thus far the only protein in which mutations of the PH domain have been found to cause a disease. The three-dimensional structure of the Btk PH domain was modeled on the basis of the dynamin PH structure. Despite a relatively low sequence similarity the Btk PH domain seems to have the same two beta-sheet structure observed in the known structures. The model was used to interpret the structural basis for disease in five independent point mutations and in an insertion in patients with XLA. The mutated residues F25, V64, and V113, and possibly residue(s) around Q103, could form a binding site, since these amino acids are located close to each other on the surface of the molecule.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated circulating markers of bone turnover before and during systemic glucocorticoid treatment in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Twenty-two children (mean age, 12.3 years) with IBD necessitating peroral steroid therapy were studied, with special reference to bone formation and resorption markers amino-terminal type I collagen propeptide (PINP) and carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) respectively. In addition, GH-related IGF-I and sex hormone-binding protein (SHBG) were measured. Bone markers were analyzed at the initiation of the glucocorticoid treatment, at 2 and 5 weeks thereafter and at 1 month following the withdrawal of the steroid. Control group comprised 22 IBD patients in remission. RESULTS: PINP and IGF-I were already lower before glucocorticoid treatment serum in children with active IBD as compared with control children with IBD in remission (median PINP 271 vs 535 microg/l, P<0.05; IGF-I 23 vs 29 nmol/l, P<0.05). After 2 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment serum PINP levels had declined further, from 271 to 163 microg/l (P<0.001), serum ICTP from 14.2 to 9.6 microg/l (P<0.001), and SHBG from 54 to 35 nmol/l (P<0.001) respectively. By contrast, serum IGF-I increased from 23 to 37 nmol/l (P<0.001). One month after the withdrawal of the glucocorticoid, all bone markers restored to levels similar to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Bone formation in children with active IBD appears compromised and systemic glucocorticoid treatment further suppresses bone turnover. After the cessation of the glucocorticoid the bone markers show immediate improvement.},

   abstract = {GOALS: Our objective was to investigate the changes in circulating glucocorticoid bioactivity (GBA) at the onset of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. STUDY: Prednisolone (1 mg/kg/d) or budesonide (9 mg/d) was introduced as a single daily dose, and the patients (n=22) were subsequently followed up at 2 to 4 week intervals. The limit for a raised value of serum GBA was defined in pediatric patients (mean+2 SD; 118 nM cortisol equivalents; n=142). RESULTS: Two weeks of prednisolone brought about an increase in serum GBA from 84+/-14 to 336+/-38 nM cortisol equivalents (mean+/-SE; P<0.001). Young patients (<10 y) had similar GBA values to older patients, even though their prednisolone dose was higher (1.3 vs. 0.79 mg/kg; P<0.05). Patients treated with budesonide displayed a minor increase in GBA (151+/-20 vs. 267+/-21 nM cortisol equivalents after 4 wk of treatment; P<0.05; n=3), and when switched to prednisolone (n=2), their GBA level increased 3-fold. GBA levels did not predict the development of glucocorticoid-related side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Prednisolone doses used in the treatment of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients elicit a 4-fold increase in serum GBA that is significantly higher than the increase induced by budesonide. The GBA measurement is an additional tool for assessing steroid therapy at an individual level during systemic glucocorticoid treatment.},

   abstract = {Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of primary immunodeficiencies, a proportion of which are due to mutations in either of the 2 recombination activating genes (RAG)-1 and -2, which mediate the process of V(D)J recombination leading to the assembly of antigen receptor genes. It is reported here that the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of patients bearing mutations in RAGs are more diverse than previously thought and that this variability is related, in part, to the specific type of RAG mutation. By analyzing 44 such patients from 41 families, the following conclusions were reached: (1) null mutations on both alleles lead to the T-B-SCID phenotype; (2) patients manifesting classic Omenn syndrome (OS) have missense mutations on at least one allele and maintain partial V(D)J recombination activity, which accounts for the generation of residual, oligoclonal T-lymphocytes; (3) in a third group of patients, findings were only partially compatible with OS, and these patients, who also carried at least one missense mutation, may be considered to have atypical SCID/OS; (4) patients with engraftment of maternal T cells as a complication of a transplacental transfusion represented a fourth group, and these patients, who often presented with a clinical phenotype mimicking OS, may be observed regardless of the type of RAG gene mutation. Analysis of the RAG genes by direct sequencing is an effective way to provide accurate diagnosis of RAG-deficient as opposed to RAG-independent V(D)J recombination defects, a distinction that cannot be made based on clinical and immunologic phenotype alone.},

This folding activity is consistent with the homology of a segment of PrsA with parvulin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIase). In this study, molecular modeling showed that the parvulin-like region can adopt a parvulin-type fold with structurally conserved active site residues. PrsA exhibits PPIase activity in a manner dependent on the parvulin-like domain. We constructed deletion, peptide insertion, and amino acid substitution mutations and demonstrated that the parvulin-like domain as well as flanking N- and C-terminal domains are essential for in vivo PrsA function in protein secretion and growth. Surprisingly, none of the predicted active site residues of the parvulin-like domain was essential for growth and protein secretion, although several active site mutations reduced or abolished the PPIase activity or the ability of PrsA to catalyze proline-limited protein folding in vitro. Our results indicate that PrsA is a PPIase, but the essential role in vivo seems to depend on some non-PPIase activity of both the parvulin-like and flanking domains.},

This chloroplast-localized redox system has been extensively studied in photosynthetic organisms and is responsible for the electron transfer from photosystem I to NADP+. Besides this light-dependent reaction in nonphotosynthetic plastids (e.g. from roots), electrons can also flow in the reverse direction, from NADPH to ferredoxin, which then serves as an important reductant for various plastid-localized enzymes. These plastids possess related, but distinct, ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and ferredoxin isoforms for this purpose. We provide phylogenetic evidence that the T. gondii reductase is similar to such nonphotosynthetic isoforms. Both the P. falciparum [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin and the T. gondii ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase possess an N-terminal bipartite transit peptide domain typical for apicoplast-localized proteins. The recombinant proteins were obtained in active form, and antibodies raised against the reductase recognized two bands on Western blots of T. gondii tachyzoite lysates, indicative of the unprocessed and native form, respectively. We propose that the role of this redox system is to provide reduced ferredoxin, which might then be used for fatty acid desaturation or other biosynthetic processes yet to be defined. Thus, the interaction of these two proteins offers an attractive target for drug intervention.},

Apart from a large deletion involving exon 19, nine missense (F25S, R288W, 1370M, M509V, R525P, N526K, R562W, A582V and G594R), two nonsense (E277X and R525X), five frameshift and two splice site mutations have been found affecting most coding exons and all major enzyme domains. No mutations or polymorphisms were detected in the putative promoter region. A single nucleotide deletion located in the last exon, resulting in a truncation of the eight C-terminal residues of Btk and a typical XLA phenotype, indicates structural and/or functional importance of Btk helix I in the catalytic domain. Although allelic heterogeneity at the BTK locus may partly explain clinical variability in families with XLA, compensatory and redundant mechanisms involved in B-cell development must play a role in the phenotypic diversity of the disease.},

SPP/SPPLs selectively cleave transmembrane domains in type II orientation and do not require additional co-factors for proteolytic activity. Orthologues of SPP and SPPLs have been identified in other vertebrates, plants, and eukaryotes. In line with their diverse subcellular localisations ranging from the ER (SPP, SPPL2c), the Golgi (SPPL3), the plasma membrane (SPPL2b) to lysosomes/late endosomes (SPPL2a), the different members of the SPP/SPPL family seem to exhibit distinct functions. Here, we review the substrates of these proteases identified to date as well as the current state of knowledge about the physiological implications of these proteolytic events as deduced from in vivo studies. Furthermore, the present knowledge on the structure of intramembrane proteases of the SPP/SPPL family, their cleavage mechanism and their substrate requirements are summarised.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Apicomplexan parasites are causative agents of various diseases including malaria and have been targets of extensive genomic sequencing. We generated 5'-EST collections for six apicomplexa parasites using our full-length oligo-capping cDNA library method. To improve upon the current genome annotations, as well as to validate the importance for physical cDNA clone resources, we generated a large-scale collection of full-length cDNAs for several apicomplexa parasites. RESULTS: In this study, we used a total of 61,056 5'-end-single-pass cDNA sequences from Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. yoelii, P. berghei, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Toxoplasma gondii. We compared these partially sequenced cDNA sequences with the currently annotated gene models and observed significant inconsistencies between the two datasets. In particular, we found that on average 14% of the exons in the current gene models were not supported by any cDNA evidence, and that 16% of the current gene models may contain at least one mis-annotation and should be re-evaluated. We also identified a large number of transcripts that had been previously unidentified. For 732 cDNAs in T. gondii, the entire sequences were determined in order to evaluate the annotated gene models at the complete full-length transcript level. We found that 41% of the T. gondii gene models contained at least one inconsistency. We also identified and confirmed by RT-PCR 140 previously unidentified transcripts found in the intergenic regions of the current gene annotations. We show that the majority of these discrepancies are due to questionable predictions of one or two extra exons in the upstream or downstream regions of the genes. CONCLUSION: Our data indicates that the current gene models are likely to still be incomplete and have much room for improvement. Our unique full-length cDNA information is especially useful for further refinement of the annotations for the genomes of apicomplexa parasites.},

   abstract = {Transmission-blocking immunity may have great potential for use in the control of diseases caused by apicomplexan parasites. In this review I will describe our work on the application of transmission-blocking immunity to the control of the Eimeria parasite and compare our results to those working on transmission-blocking immunity against Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium. Eimeria causes the disease known as coccidiosis in domestic animals. Coccidiosis is particularly problematic in the chicken industry, mainly due to the crowded rearing conditions under which chicks are raised. In our work we identified, isolated and characterized 3 major gametocyte antigens (230 kDa, 82 kDa and 56/54 kDa) of Eimeria maxima. We used these native glycoproteins to immunize laying hens that, via the egg yolk, provide large amounts of transmission-blocking maternal antibodies to offspring chicks. We demonstrated that hatchlings from immunized hens shed 60-80% fewer oocysts (i.e. the infective stage of the life-cycle of Eimeria) than those from control hens. Such a reduction in oocyst output acts to significantly reduce parasite numbers in the litter of chicks raised in floor pens. This reduction in oocyst output is comparable to that seen using the most effective coccidiostat drugs and is probably sufficient to control coccidiosis under field conditions. Based on our results together with those of other groups working on transmission-blocking immunity against Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium, it appears that this immunological approach holds great promise for the control of apicomplexan parasites that cause diseases in both animals and man.},

Like plant chloroplasts, apicoplasts are semi-autonomous with their own genome and expression machinery. In addition, apicoplasts import numerous proteins encoded by nuclear genes. These nuclear genes largely derive from the endosymbiont through a process of intracellular gene relocation. The exact role of a plastid in parasites is uncertain but early clues indicate synthesis of lipids, heme and isoprenoids as possibilities. The various metabolic processes of the apicoplast are potentially excellent targets for drug therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The comparison of samples, or beta diversity, is one of the essential problems in ecological studies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies make it possible to obtain large amounts of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic short read sequences across many microbial communities. De novo assembly of the short reads can be especially challenging because the number of genomes and their sequences are generally unknown and the coverage of each genome can be very low, where the traditional alignment-based sequence comparison methods cannot be used. Alignment-free approaches based on k-tuple frequencies, on the other hand, have yielded promising results for the comparison of metagenomic samples. However, it is not known if these approaches can be used for the comparison of metatranscriptome datasets and which dissimilarity measures perform the best. RESULTS: We applied several beta diversity measures based on k-tuple frequencies to real metatranscriptomic datasets from pyrosequencing 454 and Illumina sequencing platforms to evaluate their effectiveness for the clustering of metatranscriptomic samples, including three d2-type dissimilarity measures, one dissimilarity measure in CVTree, one relative entropy based measure S2 and three classical 1p-norm distances. Results showed that the measure d2(S) can achieve superior performance on clustering metatranscriptomic samples into different groups under different sequencing depths for both 454 and Illumina datasets, recovering environmental gradients affecting microbial samples, classifying coexisting metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, and being robust to sequencing errors. We also investigated the effects of tuple size and order of the background Markov model. A software pipeline to implement all the steps of analysis is built and is available at http://code.google.com/p/d2-tools/. CONCLUSIONS: The k-tuple based sequence signature measures can effectively reveal major groups and gradient variation among metatranscriptomic samples from NGS reads. The d2(S) dissimilarity measure performs well in all application scenarios and its performance is robust with respect to tuple size and order of the Markov model.},

Using a top-gate device geometry with 12 nm HfO(2) being the gate oxide, the SBG CNT-based FET exhibits an almost perfect symmetric ambipolar transfer characteristic without any noticeable hysteresis, and a highly efficient frequency doubler is constructed based on this near perfect ambipolar FET. The SBG CNT-based frequency doubler is shown to be able to operate in a large signal mode where the input AC signal, being applied to the top-gate electrode, drives the FET operating alternatively in a p- or n-region yielding an output signal at the drain electrode with doubled frequency and high conversion efficiency. For an input AC signal of 1 kHz, detailed frequency power spectrum analysis shows that more than 95% of the output signal is concentrated at the doubled frequency at 2 kHz, with a gain of more than 0.15, and this represents the highest gain so far achieved in carbon-based devices, including graphene-based devices.},

   abstract = {The heterogeneity of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) calls for a classification addressing pathogenic mechanisms as well as clinical relevance. This European multicenter trial was initiated to develop a consensus of 2 existing classification schemes based on flowcytometric B-cell phenotyping and the clinical course. The clinical evaluation of 303 patients with the established diagnosis of CVID demonstrated a significant coincidence of granulomatous disease, autoimmune cytopenia, and splenomegaly. Phenotyping of B-cell subpopulations confirmed a severe reduction of switched memory B cells in most of the patients that was associated with a higher risk for splenomegaly and granulomatous disease. An expansion of CD21(low) B cells marked patients with splenomegaly. Lymphadenopathy was significantly linked with transitional B-cell expansion. Based on these findings and pathogenic consideration of B-cell differentiation, we suggest an improved classification for CVID (EUROclass), separating patients with nearly absent B cells (less than 1%), severely reduced switched memory B cells (less than 2%), and expansion of transitional (more than 9%) or CD21(low) B cells (more than 10%). Whereas the first group contains all patients with severe defects of early B-cell differentiation, severely reduced switched memory B cells indicate a defective germinal center development as found in inducible constimulator (ICOS) or CD40L deficiency. The underlying defects of expanded transitional or CD21(low) B cells remain to be elucidated.

   abstract = {Training and testing of conventional machine learning models on binary classification problems depend on the proportions of the two outcomes in the relevant data sets. This may be especially important in practical terms when real-world applications of the classifier are either highly imbalanced or occur in unknown proportions. Intuitively, it may seem sensible to train machine learning models on data similar to the target data in terms of proportions of the two binary outcomes. However, we show that this is not the case using the example of prediction of deleterious and neutral phenotypes of human missense mutations in human genome data, for which the proportion of the binary outcome is unknown. Our results indicate that using balanced training data (50% neutral and 50% deleterious) results in the highest balanced accuracy (the average of True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate), Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under ROC curves, no matter what the proportions of the two phenotypes are in the testing data. Besides balancing the data by undersampling the majority class, other techniques in machine learning include oversampling the minority class, interpolating minority-class data points and various penalties for misclassifying the minority class. However, these techniques are not commonly used in either the missense phenotype prediction problem or in the prediction of disordered residues in proteins, where the imbalance problem is substantial. The appropriate approach depends on the amount of available data and the specific problem at hand.},

   abstract = {Presenilin is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It is thought to constitute the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex that catalyzes intramembrane cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein, the last step in the generation of amyloidogenic Abeta peptides. The latter are major constituents of amyloid plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Inhibitors of gamma-secretase are considered potential therapeutics for the treatment of this disease because they prevent production of Abeta peptides. Recently, we discovered a family of presenilin-type aspartic proteases. The founding member, signal peptide peptidase, catalyzes intramembrane cleavage of distinct signal peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of animals. In humans, the protease plays a crucial role in the immune system. Moreover, it is exploited by the hepatitis C virus for the processing of the structural components of the virion and hence is an attractive target for anti-infective intervention. Signal peptide peptidase and presenilin share identical active site motifs and both catalyze intramembrane proteolysis. These common features let us speculate that gamma-secretase inhibitors directed against presenilin may also inhibit signal peptide peptidase. Here we demonstrate that some of the most potent known gamma-secretase inhibitors efficiently inhibit signal peptide peptidase. However, we found compounds that showed higher specificity for one or the other protease. Our findings highlight the possibility of developing selective inhibitors aimed at reducing Abeta generation without affecting other intramembrane-cleaving aspartic proteases.},

We found hydrophobicity autocorrelation functions to be strongly oscillating. Another strong signal is the monotonously decaying alpha-helix propensity autocorrelation function. Furthermore, we detected signals corresponding to an alteration of positively and negatively charged residues at a distance of 3-4 amino acids. To look beyond the property codes gained by the methods of physical chemistry, mappings yielding a strong correlation signal are sought for using a Monte Carlo simulation. The mappings leading to strong signals are found to be related to hydrophobicity of alpha-helix propensity. A cluster analysis of the top scoring mappings leads to two novel property codes. These two property codes are gained from sequence data only. They turn out to be similar to known property codes for hydrophobicity or polarity.},

   abstract = {Malaria kills an estimated one million people a year--mostly children under 5. State-of-the-art medicines known as artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are available, and successfully cure up to 99% of patients. Additionally, insecticide-treated bed nets and insecticide spraying are helping to prevent the disease, while a vaccine is in clinical development. With all these tools at hand, you might ask why we need more new medicines. Why not just concentrate on improving the distribution of existing ones? Whilst access to medicines is clearly a major challenge, there are several reasons why new antimalarials are urgently needed--and will continue to be needed until we have finally defeated the parasite. First, the emergence of drug resistance to any infectious disease treatment is inevitable. A range of medicines with varying mechanisms of action are needed to stem the tide of drug resistance as well as fill the gap when it takes hold. Second, malaria is a disease predominantly affecting children and expectant mothers. These vulnerable patient groups require medicines tailored to their needs with robust safety profiles. Third, of the five species of malarial parasites that infect humans, two can relapse, and there is currently no safe medicine to combat the relapse for all patients. Finally, in order to ultimately eradicate malaria, medicines are needed that go a step beyond simple treatment and break the transmission of the parasite from patient to patient.},

   abstract = {Tissue-encysting coccidia, including Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona, are heterogamous parasites with sexual and asexual life stages in definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. During its sexual life stage, T. gondii reproduces either by genetic out-crossing or via clonal amplification of a single strain through self-mating. Out-crossing has been experimentally verified as a potent mechanism capable of producing offspring possessing a range of adaptive and virulence potentials. In contrast, selfing and other life history traits, such as asexual expansion of tissue-cysts by oral transmission among intermediate hosts, have been proposed to explain the genetic basis for the clonal population structure of T. gondii. In this study, we investigated the contributing roles self-mating and sexual recombination play in nature to maintain clonal population structures and produce or expand parasite clones capable of causing disease epidemics for two tissue encysting parasites. We applied high-resolution genotyping against strains isolated from a T. gondii waterborne outbreak that caused symptomatic disease in 155 immune-competent people in Brazil and a S. neurona outbreak that resulted in a mass mortality event in Southern sea otters. In both cases, a single, genetically distinct clone was found infecting outbreak-exposed individuals. Furthermore, the T. gondii outbreak clone was one of several apparently recombinant progeny recovered from the local environment. Since oocysts or sporocysts were the infectious form implicated in each outbreak, the expansion of the epidemic clone can be explained by self-mating. The results also show that out-crossing preceded selfing to produce the virulent T. gondii clone. For the tissue encysting coccidia, self-mating exists as a key adaptation potentiating the epidemic expansion and transmission of newly emerged parasite clones that can profoundly shape parasite population genetic structures or cause devastating disease outbreaks.},

   abstract = {In contrast to the rapid inhibition of bacterial cytidine deaminase by 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine, the onset of inhibition of the enzyme from human liver was found to be relatively slow. Inhibition was found to be reversible, and the corrected rate constants for binding (kon = 2.4 x 10(4) M-1 sec-1) and release (koff = 5.6 x 10(-4) sec-1) were in reasonable agreement with a Ki value (2.9 x 10(-8) M) measured separately under steady-state conditions, which was several orders of magnitude lower than estimates previously reported in the literature. Rates of binding and release of this potential transition state analogue were not appreciably affected by the substitution of deuterium oxide for solvent water. The slow onset of inhibition, which was also observed for cytidine deaminase from HeLa cells, suggests that structural reorganization precedes the formation of a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex. 6-Azacytidine, which favors a "high-anti" configuration at the glycosidic bond, was found to be active as a substrate for cytidine deaminase, with a turnover number exceeding that of cytidine. 2,2'-Anhydro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, which is restricted to the "syn" configuration, was found to be without activity as a substrate or an inhibitor.},

Here, we discuss recent applications of this principle to the study of gametocyte sex ratios in malaria and other apicomplexan parasites. Sex ratios matter because they are an important determinant of fitness and transmission success -- and hence of disease epidemiology and evolution. Moreover, inbreeding rates can be estimated from gametocyte sex ratios. The sex ratio is also an excellent model trait for testing the validity of important components of what is being marketed as 'Darwinian medicine'.},

   abstract = {Establishing the selfing, rate of parasites is important for studies in clinical and epidemiological medicine as well as evolutionary biology Sex allocation theory offers a relatively cheap and easy way to estimate selfing rates in natural parasite populations. Local mate competition (LMC) theory predicts that the optimal sex ratio (r*; defined as proportion males) is related to the selfing rate (s) by the equation r* = (1-s)/2. In this paper, we generalize the application of sex allocation theory across parasitic protozoa in the phylum Apicomplexa. This cosmopolitan phylum consists entirely of parasites, and includes a number of species of medical and veterinary importance. We suggest that LMC theory should apply to eimeriorin intestinal parasites. As predicted, data from 13 eimeriorin species showed a female-biased sex ratio, with the sex ratios suggesting high levels of selfing (0.8-1.0). Importantly, our estimate of the selfing rate in one of these species, Toxoplasma gondii, is in agreement with previous genetic analyses. In contrast, we predict that LMC theory will not apply to the groups in which syzygy occurs (adeleorins, gregarines and piroplasms). Syzygy occurs when a single male gametocyte and a single female gametocyte pair together physically or in close proximity, just prior to fertilization. As predicted, data from four adeleorin species showed sex ratios not significantly different from 0.5.},

Using reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers, IAPP was identified, and its deduced amino-acid sequence partially characterized, in three species of teleostean fish, i.e. Danio rerio (zebrafish), Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon), and Myoxocephalus (cottus) scorpius (daddy sculpin). The daddy sculpin is a species where the histophysiology of the pancreatic islet parenchyma has previously been comprehensively studied. From the deduced amino-acid sequence, a synthetic peptide, corresponding to positions 20-29 of Salmo IAPP, was synthesized. A mouse antiserum to this peptide gave a distinct immunoreactivity with the insulin-producing beta cells of the sculpin Brockmann bodies and salmon endocrine pancreas. Thus, IAPP belongs to the group of peptide hormones expressed by the islet parenchymal cells in both mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. Salmo salar IAPP(20-29) was found to give rise to amyloid-like fibrils in vitro.},

   abstract = {Host cell entry by Toxoplasma gondii depends critically on actin filaments in the parasite, yet paradoxically, its actin is almost exclusively monomeric. In contrast to the absence of stable filaments in conventional samples, rapid-freeze electron microscopy revealed that actin filaments were formed beneath the plasma membrane of gliding parasites. To investigate the role of actin filaments in motility, we treated parasites with the filament-stabilizing drug jasplakinolide (JAS) and monitored the distribution of actin in live and fixed cells using yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-actin. JAS treatment caused YFP-actin to redistribute to the apical and posterior ends, where filaments formed a spiral pattern subtending the plasma membrane. Although previous studies have suggested that JAS induces rigor, videomicroscopy demonstrated that JAS treatment increased the rate of parasite gliding by approximately threefold, indicating that filaments are rate limiting for motility. However, JAS also frequently reversed the normal direction of motility, disrupting forward migration and cell entry. Consistent with this alteration, subcortical filaments in JAS-treated parasites occurred in tangled plaques as opposed to the straight, roughly parallel orientation observed in control cells. These studies reveal that precisely controlled polymerization of actin filaments imparts the correct timing, duration, and directionality of gliding motility in the Apicomplexa.},

Several ACT drugs exist and others are in the pipeline. If properly targeted, they have the potential to reduce mortality from malaria substantially. The major challenge now is to get the drugs to the right people. Current evidence suggests that most of those who need the drugs do not get them. Simultaneously, a high proportion of those who are given antimalarials do not in fact have malaria. Financial and other barriers mean that, in many settings, the majority of those with malaria, particularly the poorest, do not access formal healthcare, so the provision of free antimalarials via this route has only limited impact. The higher cost of ACT creates a market for fake drugs. Addressing these problems is now a priority. This review outlines current evidence, possible solutions and research priorities.},

   abstract = {Malaria is a serious parasitic infection, which affects millions of people worldwide. As pregnancy has been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of many medications, the efficacy and safety of antimalarial drug regimens may be compromised in pregnant women. The objective of this review is to systematically review published literature on the pharmacokinetics of antimalarial agents in pregnant women. A search of MEDLINE (1948-May 2011), EMBASE (1980-May 2011), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2011), Google and Google Scholar was conducted for articles describing the pharmacokinetics of antimalarials in pregnancy (and supplemented by a bibliographic review of all relevant articles); all identified studies were summarized and evaluated according to the level of evidence, based on the classification system developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Identified articles were included in the review if the study had at least one group that reported at least one pharmacokinetic parameter of interest in pregnant women. Articles were excluded from the review if no pharmacokinetic information was reported or if both pregnant and non-pregnant women were analysed within the same group. For quinine and its metabolites, there were three articles (one level II-1 and two level III); for artemisinin compounds, two articles (both level III); for lumefantrine, two articles (both level III); for atovaquone, two articles (both level III); for proguanil, three articles (one level II-1 and two level III); for sulfadoxine, three articles (all level II-1); for pyrimethamine, three articles (all level II-1); for chloroquine and its metabolite, four articles (three level II-1 and one level II-3); for mefloquine, two articles (one level II-1 and one level III); and for azithromycin, two articles (one level II-1 and one level III). Although comparative trials were identified, most of these studies were descriptive and classified as level III evidence. The main findings showed that pharmacokinetic parameters are commonly altered in pregnancy for the majority of recommended agents. Importantly, first-line regimens of artemisinin-based compounds, lumefantrine, chloroquine and pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine may undergo significant changes that could decrease therapeutic efficacy. These changes are usually due to increases in the apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution that commonly occur in pregnant women, and may result in decreased exposure and increased therapeutic failure. In order to assess the clinical implications of these changes and to provide safe and effective dosage regimens, there is an immediate need for dose-optimization studies of all recommended first- and second-line agents used in pregnant women with malaria.},

The results can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless distribution coefficient for transfer of a compound from dilute aqueous solution to the vapor phase. For acetic acid this coefficient is 1.1 X 10(-5), for acetamide 7.6 X 10(-8), for N-methylacetamide 4.1 X 10(-8), and for N,N-dimethylacetamide 5.4 X 10(-7). Thus acetamide is much more strongly solvated than the uncharged acetic acid molecule. The results suggest: (1) that the peptide bond represents an extreme among uncharged functional groups in the degree to which it is stabilized by solvent water; (2) that the very great hydrophilic character of the peptide bond may be associated mainly with hydrogen bonding of the solvent to the carbonyl oxygen atom (rather than the N-H group); and (3) that the observed equilibria of biosynthesis and hydrolysis of peptide bonds in aqueous solution are largely determined by differences between reactants and products in their free energies of solvation. It is anticipated that where "bound" water is found in proteins, it will often be found to be associated with peptide bonds, and will tend to be associated with the C-O group rather than with the N-H group.},

When two or more functional groups are present within the same solute molecule, their combined effects on its free energy of solvation are commonly additive. Striking departures from additivity, observed in certain cases, indicate the existence of special interactions between different parts of a solute molecule and the water that surrounds it.

The magnitude of this contribution becomes even more striking when differences in free energy of solvation by water are taken into account.

The validity of this relationship is not affected by the detailed mechanism by which any particular enzyme may act, or on whether changes in enzyme conformation occur on the path to the transition state. It subsumes potential effects of substrate desolvation, H-bonding and other polar attractions, and the juxtaposition of several substrates in a configuration appropriate for reaction. The startling rate enhancements that some enzymes produce have only recently been recognized. Direct measurements of the binding affinities of stable transition-state analog inhibitors confirm the remarkable power of binding discrimination of enzymes. Several parts of the enzyme and substrate, that contribute to S binding, exhibit extremely large connectivity effects, with effective relative concentrations in excess of 10(8) M. Exact structures of enzyme complexes with transition-state analogs also indicate a general tendency of enzyme active sites to close around S in such a way as to maximize binding contacts. The role of solvent water in these binding equilibria, for which Walter Kauzmann provided a primer, is only beginning to be appreciated.},

   abstract = {The rates of enzyme reactions fall within a relatively narrow range. To estimate the rate enhancements produced by enzymes, and their expected affinities for transition state analog inhibitors, it is necessary to measure the rates of the corresponding reactions in water in the absence of a catalyst. This review describes the spontaneous cleavages of C-C, C-H, C-N, C-O, P-O, and S-O bonds in biological molecules, as well as the uncatalyzed reactions that correspond to phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by kinases and to peptidyl transfer in the ribosome. The rates of these reactions, some with half-lives in excess of one million years, span an overall range of 10(1)(9)-fold. Moreover, the slowest reactions tend to be most sensitive to temperature, with rates that increase as much as 10(7)-fold when the temperature is raised from 25 degrees to 100 degrees C. That tendency collapses, by many orders of magnitude, the time that would have been required for chemical evolution on a warm earth. If the catalytic effect of primitive enzymes, like that of modern enzymes and many nonenzymatic catalysts, were mainly to reduce a reaction's enthalpy of activation, then the resulting rate enhancement would have increased automatically as the surroundings cooled. By reducing the time required for early chemical evolution in a warm environment, these findings counter the view that not enough time has passed for terrestrial life to have evolved to its present level of complexity.},

   abstract = {Ever since the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, questions have been raised about whether enough time has elapsed for living organisms to have reached their present level of complexity by mutation and natural selection. More recently, it has become apparent that life originated very early in Earth's history, and there has been controversy as to whether life originated in a hot or cold environment. This review describes evidence that rising temperature accelerates slow reactions disproportionately, and to a much greater extent than has been generally recognized. Thus, the time that would have been required for primordial chemistry to become established would have been abbreviated profoundly at high temperatures. Moreover, if the catalytic effect of a primitive enzyme (like that of modern enzymes) were to reduce a reaction's heat of activation, then the rate enhancement that it produced would have increased as the surroundings cooled, quite aside from changes arising from mutation (which is itself highly sensitive to temperature). Some nonenzymatic catalysts of slow reactions, including PLP as a catalyst of amino acid decarboxylation, and the Ce(IV) ion as a catalyst of phosphate ester hydrolysis, have been shown to meet that criterion. The work reviewed here suggests that elevated temperatures collapsed the time required for early evolution on Earth, furnishing an appropriate setting for exploring the vast range of chemical possibilities and for the rapid evolution of enzymes from primitive catalysts.},

To determine whether these relationships might also have been valid in the warm surroundings where life may have originated, we examined the effect of temperature on the hydrophobicities of the amino acids as measured by the equilibrium constants for transfer of their side-chains from neutral solution to cyclohexane (Kw > c). The hydrophobicities of most amino acids were found to increase with increasing temperature. Because that effect is more pronounced for the more polar amino acids, the numerical range of Kw > c values decreases with increasing temperature. There are also modest changes in the ordering of the more polar amino acids. However, those changes are such that they would have tended to minimize the otherwise disruptive effects of a changing thermal environment on the evolution of protein structure. Earlier, the genetic code was found to be organized in such a way that-with a single exception (threonine)-the side-chain dichotomy polar/nonpolar matches the nucleic acid base dichotomy purine/pyrimidine at the second position of each coding triplet at 25 degrees C. That dichotomy is preserved at 100 degrees C. The accessible surface areas of amino acid side-chains in folded proteins are moderately correlated with hydrophobicity, but when free energies of vapor-to-cyclohexane transfer (corresponding to size) are taken into consideration, a closer relationship becomes apparent.},

   abstract = {When carbohydrates in aqueous solution combine with biological receptors, their interactions with the binding site take the place of previous interactions with solvent water. Free energies of binding can therefore be considered to depend on free energies of solvation of the interacting partners before and after complexation. Because carbohydrates contain so many polar substituents, their overall preferences for aqueous surroundings are overwhelming, so that they do not yield readily to analysis of their solvation properties. We therefore decided to eliminate most of the secondary hydroxyl groups and to compare the distribution properties of simple sugar analogs based on tetrahydropyran. The results suggest that compounds containing an anomeric hydroxyl group are less strongly solvated than expected from the properties of simple alcohols. Group transfer potentials of O- and N-glycosides, lactones, and acylals are substantially affected by differences in free energy of solvation between reactants and products. In contrast, equilibria of ring chain tautomerism and covalent hydration of aldoses are almost completely insensitive to the polarity of their surroundings.},

As a result of this unexpected coincidence, the equilibrium constant for entry of an isolated water molecule from the vapor phase into cyclohexane is almost exactly unity at room temperature. Molecules smaller than water prefer the vapor phase, whereas molecules larger than water prefer cyclohexane. In equilibrium with liquid water, the tendency of single water molecules to enter small nonpolar cavities, such as may be present in mutant proteins, is expected to be vanishingly small.},

In the absence of enzymes, these same reactions are among the slowest that have ever been measured, some with half-times approaching the age of the Earth. This difference provides a measure of the proficiencies of enzymes as catalysts and their relative susceptibilities to inhibition by transition-state analogue inhibitors. Thermodynamic comparisons between spontaneous and enzyme-catalyzed reactions, coupled with structural information, suggest that in addition to electrostatic and H-bonding interactions, the liberation of water molecules from an enzyme's active site into bulk solvent sometimes plays a prominent role in determining the relative binding affinities of the altered substrate in the ground state and transition state. These comparisons also indicate a high level of synergism in the action of binding determinants of both the substrate and the enzyme, that are not directly involved in the chemical transformation of the substrate but contribute to the rate of its transformation at an enzyme's active site.},

(1969), Biochemistry 8, 2412-2415). Reactivity of 6-substituents, toward nucleophilic displacement, is found to be affected only slightly by removal of ribose as a 9-substituent, in model reactions. Substituent ribose thus appears to stabilize, selectively, the transition state for enzymatic deamination. In contrast with the small influence of substituent ribose on the apparent binding affinity of substrates, removal of substituent ribose from a potential transition state analogue, 1,6-dihydro-6-hydroxy-methylpurine ribonucleoside, results in a lowering of its affinity for the enzyme by several orders of magnitude. The synthesis of the analogue and related compounds is described, and their properties compared with those of other photoadducts and of the naturally occurring inhibitors covidarabine and coformycin. Binding of these inhibitors is found to result in the appearance of ultraviolet-absorbing bands in the neighborhood of 323 nm.},

   abstract = {Alkyl sulfate monoesters are involved in cell signaling and structure. Alkyl sulfates are also present in many commercial detergents. Here, we show that monomethyl sulfate acts as an efficient alkylating agent in water, reacting spontaneously with oxygen nucleophiles >100-fold more rapidly than do alkylsulfonium ions, the usual methyl donors in living organisms. These reactions of methyl sulfate, which are much more rapid than its hydrolysis, are insensitive to the nature of the attacking nucleophile, with a Bronsted beta(nuc) value of -0.01. Experiments at elevated temperatures indicate a rate constant of 2 x 10(-11) s(-1) for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of methyl sulfate at 25 degrees C (t(1/2) = 1,100 y), corresponding to a rate enhancement of approximately 10(11)-fold by a human alkylsulfatase. Equilibria of formation of methyl sulfate from methanol and sodium hydrogen sulfate indicate a group transfer potential (DeltaG'(pH7)) of -8.9 kcal/mol for sulfate ester hydrolysis. The magnitude of that value, involving release of the strong acid HSO(4)(-), helps to explain the need for harnessing the free energy of hydrolysis of two ATP molecules in activating sulfate for the biosynthesis of sulfate monoesters. The "energy-rich" nature of monoalkyl sulfate esters, coupled with their marked resistance to hydrolysis, renders them capable of acting as sulfating or alkylating agents under relatively mild conditions. These findings raise the possibility that, under appropriate circumstances, alkyl groups may undergo transfer from alkyl sulfate monoesters to biological target molecules.},

Thus, polysaccharide hydrolases (e.g., beta-amylase) generate the largest rate enhancements that are known to be produced by hydrolytic enzymes that operate without the assistance of metals or other cofactors.(6) Here, we describe the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of sucrose and trehalose, in which the constituent monosaccharides are symmetrically joined, by a "head-to-head" glycosidic linkage between their carbonyl groups (Chart ).},

A total of 3 experiments were performed to assess the infection and clearance rate of each of these constructs. Each construct or Salmonella Enteriditis was orally administered to broiler chicks at day of hatch by oral gavage (~10(8) cfu/chick). In experiments 1 to 3, liver-spleen and cecal tonsils were removed aseptically for recovery of wild-type Salmonella Enteriditis or DeltaSE mutants. These experiments suggested that cell surface expression of fliC alone markedly increased the clearance rate of the vector at or before 21d postvaccination in all 3 experiments. In a fourth experiment, broilers were vaccinated with one of the vaccine constructs or the DeltaSE empty vector and then challenged with wild-type Salmonella Typhimurium. At 19 d posthatch, 16 d postinfection, neither candidate protected against challenge significantly better than the DeltaSE empty vector, although there was significantly less Salmonella recovered from vaccinated chickens as compared with nonvaccinated controls. These experiments indicate that these experimental vaccines did not protect against heterologous challenge or enhance clearance after Salmonella Typhimurium challenge; as such, their value as vaccines is limited. The increased clearance of the candidate vaccines, particularly the vector expressing fliC alone, may have value in that the fliC epitope may decrease the clearance time of other recombinant vectored Salmonella vaccines.},

Additionally, an effective direct-fed microbial (DFM) may offer an effective alternative to antibiotic growth promoters. Previously, 4 Bacillus isolates were identified and evaluated in our laboratory as potential DFM candidates. These isolates were shown to significantly increase BWG as well as reduce recovery of Salmonella after experimental infection. In the first experiment, isolates PHL-MM65 (a Bacillus laterosporus) and PHL-NP122 (a Bacillus subtilis) were evaluated using poults raised under commercial conditions. After 7 d of conventional brooding, poults were tagged, weighed, and placed in 1 of 4 replicate pens for each treatment group [negative control, 0.019% nitarsone, PHL-MM65 (10(6) spores/g of feed), or PHL-NP122 (10(6) spores/g of feed)] within the commercial turkey barn. At 23 d, poults were weighed and BW was calculated. Treatment with PHL-NP122 (853 g) or nitarsone (852 g) increased BW (P </= 0.05) compared with control (784 g), whereas treatment with PHL-MM65 (794 g) did not significantly improve BW. Also on d 23 of the trial, ceca were aseptically removed from 10 poults per pen and cultured for recovery of Salmonella. Both Bacillus isolates PHL-NP122 and PHL-MM65 resulted in a significant reduction (P </= 0.05) in the frequency of Salmonella by more than 25% compared with the controls. In a second experiment on a different farm, isolates PHL-NP122, PHL-RW33 (a B. subtilis), and PHL-B1 (a Bacillus licheniformis) were evaluated. None of the candidate Bacillus DFM or the group fed nitarsone had significantly different BW or BWG than untreated control. These data suggest that isolate PHL-NP122, when added as a DFM to turkey diets, may increase BW gain as well as nitarsone during the brooding phase of commercial turkey production.},

It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree) and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine (SVM) framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the SVM method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80% sensitivity and 99.6% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes, which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool (SpiderP) is freely available on ArachnoServer (http://www.arachnoserver.org/spiderP.html), a web portal to a comprehensive relational database of spider toxins. All training data, test data, and scripts used are available from the SpiderP website.},

The absence of effective vaccines and widespread resistance to many of the current antimalarials make this disease an urgent target for the scientific community. As a developing world disease, most of the efforts towards new drugs have been from academic and government supported projects. This has recently changed with the emergence of new funding mechanisms and public-private partnerships (PPP). The purpose of this review is to highlight the different approaches used to discover new antimalarial agents, including target-based approaches, derivatization of known antimalarial pharmacophores, drug repositioning from non-malaria indication and cell-based screening. Specific examples are provided to illustrate the pros and cons in the context of how to best address the ever-increasing drug resistance and how to cost-effectively identify new antimalarials. More attention is given to relatively mature programs that have gone through extensive SAR study, pharmacology and/or toxicity studies in the last ten years.},

X-ray crystal structures of complexes with the two matched inhibitors differ only near a "trapped" water molecule in the complex with the 3,4-dihydro analog, where contacts are substantially less favorable than those with the hydroxyl group of the transition-state analog. The hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the Glu 104 carboxylate shortens in that complex, and may become a "low-barrier" hydrogen bond, since at the same time the bond between zinc and the Cys 132 thiolate ligand lengthens. These differences must therefore account for most of the differential binding affinity related to catalysis. Moreover, the trapped water molecule retains some of the binding energy stabilizing the hydroxyl group in the transition-state analog complex. To this extent, the ratio of binding affinities for the two compounds is smaller than the true contribution of the hydroxyl group, a conclusion with significant bearing on interpreting difference free energies derived from substituent effects arising from chemical modification and/or mutagenesis.},

(1995) Biochemistry 34, 4516-4523]. Difference Fourier maps between the deazacytidine, dihydrozebularine, and zebularine--hydrate inhibitor complexes suggest that the ring itself moves successively toward the activated water, leaving the amino group behind in this site as the substrate complex approaches the transition state. They also reveal systematic changes in a single zinc-sulfur bond distance. These correlate with chemical changes expected as the substrate approaches the tetrahedral transition state, in which the zinc-activated hydroxyl group develops maximal negative charge and forms a short hydrogen bond to the neighboring carboxylate group of Glu 104. Empirical bond valence relationships suggest that the Zn-S gamma 132 bond functions throughout the reaction as a "valence buffer" that accommodates changing negative charge on the hydroxyl group. Similar structural features in alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that analogous mechanisms may be a general feature of catalysis by zinc enzymes.},

   abstract = {Crystal structures of the cytidine deaminase-uridine product complex prepared either by cocrystallizing enzyme with uridine or by diffusing cytidine into ligand-free crystals show that the product binds as a 4-ketopyrimidine. They reveal four additional features of the catalytic process. (1) A water molecule bound to a site previously observed to bind the incoming 4-NH2 group represents the site for the leaving ammonia molecule. The conserved Pro 128 accommodates both moieties by orienting the carbonyl group of the previous residue. (2) The Glu 104 carboxylate group rotates from its hydrogen bond to the O4 hydroxyl group in transition-state analog complexes, forming a new hydrogen bond to the leaving group moiety. Thus, after stabilizing the hydroxyl group in the transition state, Glu 104 transfers a proton from that group to the leaving amino group, promoting enol-to-keto isomerization of the product. (3) Difference Fourier comparisons with transition-state complexes indicate that the pyrimidine ring rotates toward the zinc by approximately 10 degrees. The active site thus "pulls" the ring and 4-NH2 group in opposite directions during catalysis. To preserve coplanarity of the 4-keto group with the pyrimidine ring, the N1-C1' glycosidic bond bends by approximately 19 degrees out of the ring plane. This distortion may "spring-load" the product complex and promote dissociation. Failure to recognize a similar distortion could explain an earlier crystallographic interpretation of the adenosine deaminase-inosine complex [Wilson, D. K., & Quiocho, F. A. (1994) Nat. Struct. Biol. 1, 691-694]. (4) The Zn-Sgamma132 bond, which lengthens in transition-state complexes, shortens as the O4 atom returns to a state of lower negative charge in the planar product, consistent with our previous proposal that this bond buffers the zinc bond valence, compensating buildup of negative charge on the oxygen nucleophile during catalysis.},

   abstract = {Artemisinin drugs have become the first-line antimalarials in areas of multidrug resistance. However, monotherapy with artemisinin drugs results in comparatively high recrudescence rates. Autoinduction of cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated metabolism, resulting in reduced exposure, has been supposed to be the underlying mechanism. To better understand the autoinduction and metabolic drug-drug interactions (DDIs), we evaluated the P450s (particularly CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) inhibited or induced by two artemisinin drugs, Qing-hao-su (QHS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) using human liver microsome, recombinant P450 enzymes, and primary human hepatocytes. The results suggested that QHS was a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP2B6 (K(i) 4.6 muM), but not CYP3A4 (IC(5)(0) approximately 50 muM) and did not show measurable time-dependent inhibition of either CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. DHA inhibited neither CYP2B6 nor CYP3A4 (IC(5)(0) > 125 muM). In addition, it was found that QHS induced the activity of CYP3A4 (E(max) 3.5-fold and EC(5)(0) 5.9 muM) and CYP2B6 (E(max) 1.9-fold and EC(5)(0) 0.6 muM). Of the other P450s, UDP glucuronosyltransferases, and transporters studied, QHS and DHA had no significant effect except for minor induction of mRNA expression of CYP1A2 (E(max) 7.9-fold and EC(5)(0) 5.2 muM) and CYP2A6 (E(max) 11.7-fold and EC(5)(0) 4.0 muM) by QHS. Quantitative prediction of P450-mediated DDIs indicate autoinduction of QHS clearance with the AUC(i)/AUC ratio decreasing to 59%, as a result of a 1.9-fold increase in CYP3A4 and a 1.6-fold increase in CYP2B6 activity. These data suggest that QHS drugs are potential inducers of P450 enzymes, and the possible drug interactions (or lack thereof) with artemisinin drugs may be clinically relevant.},

Plasmids harboring the gene complemented chromosomal cdd mutations, enhanced cytidine deaminase activity in cell extracts, and directed the synthesis of a protein identical in mass and N-terminal amino acid sequence with cytidine deaminase purified from wild-type bacteria. Metal analysis of the purified, plasmid-encoded deaminase indicated a single atom of tightly bound zinc per subunit. Earlier work has shown that bacterial cytidine deaminase and mammalian adenosine deaminase are remarkably alike in their mechanisms of action, in their free energies of interaction with analogue inhibitors resembling tetrahedral intermediates in nucleophilic substitution, and in their ability to discriminate between analogue inhibitors differing by a single hydroxyl group. In contrast to these shared catalytic similarities, the deduced amino acid sequence of E. coli cytidine deaminase (monomer MW 31,540) differs markedly from the mammalian adenosine deaminase sequence suggesting major differences in their tertiary structures. Nevertheless, cytidine deaminase and mammalian plus bacterial adenosine deaminases share a single region (TVHA) of sequence identity that is tentatively identified as part of the cytidine deaminase active site.},

Few oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and no suspected falsified medicines were found. All 291 samples contained the stated active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of which 69% were considered good quality by chemical analysis. Overall, medicine quality did not differ by collection method, although open surveyors were less likely to obtain oral artemisinin-based monotherapies than MCs. The results are an encouraging indication of the positive impact of the country's efforts to tackle falsified antimalarials and artemisinin-based monotherapies. However, poor-quality medicines remain an ongoing challenge that demands sustained political will and investment of human and financial resources.},

We describe the findings of Operation Storm I and II conducted in 2008-2009 to combat counterfeit medicines through partnership between national customs, Drug Regulatory Agencies (DRAs), and police in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Samples were obtained from seizures and market surveillance by national DRAs. Laboratory analysis using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques and examination of packaging were performed. Ninety-three suspect antibiotics and 95 antimalarial samples were collected. Of the 93 antibiotics, 29 (31%) had % active pharmaceutical ingredient content (%API) < 85% or > 115% (including one counterfeit). Of the 95 antimalarials, 30 (32%) had %API < 85 > 115% API (including one counterfeit). A significant minority of samples, antimalarials (13%) and antibiotics (15%), were collected in plastic bags with minimal or no labeling. Of 20 ampicillin samples, 13 (65%) contained < 85% API (with one counterfeit containing additional amoxicillin). Of 34 oral artesunate samples, 7 (21%) contained %API out of the 85-115% range. Coordinated and synergistic partnership adopted by the participating countries, International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), World Health Organization (WHO), and laboratories facilitated a platform for discussions and intelligence sharing, helping to improve each participating country's capacity to combat poor-quality medicines.},

Synthesis and structure-activity studies identified a number of promising compounds with selective antiplasmodial activity. One of these frontrunner compounds, 15, was equipotent across the two strains (K1 = 25.0 nM, NF54 = 28.0 nM) and superior to chloroquine in the K1 strain (chloroquine IC(50) K1 = 194.0 nM). Compound 15 completely cured Plasmodium berghei-infected mice with a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg. Dose-response studies generated ED(50) and ED(90) values of 0.83 and 1.74 mg/kg for 15 in the standard four-dose Peters test. Pharmacokinetic studies in the rat indicated that this compound has good oral bioavailability (51% at 20 mg/kg) and a reasonable half-life (t(1/2) approximately 7-8 h).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although hundreds of different signal peptides have now been identified, few studies have examined the factors enabling signal peptides to augment secretion of mature proteins. Signal peptides, located at the N-terminus of nascent secreted proteins, characteristically have three domains: (1) a basic domain at the N-terminus, (2) a central hydrophobic core, and (3) a carboxy-terminal cleavage region. In this study, we investigated whether alterations in the basic and/or the hydrophobic domains of a commonly used signal peptide from interleukin-2 (IL-2) affected secretion of two proteins: placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) and endostatin. METHODS: A series of modifications in the basic and/or hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide were made by polymerase chain reaction with endostatin or AP plasmids as templates. Transfection of wild-type or modified IL-2 signal peptides fused in-frame with endostatin or AP were done with Superfect in vitro or by the hydrodynamic method in vivo. RESULTS: Increasing both the basicity and hydrophobicity of the signal peptide augmented the secretion of AP and endostatin by approximately 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively, from MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro. Over a range of DNA concentrations and times, the most effective IL-2 signal peptide increased AP levels in the medium compared to the wild-type IL-2 signal peptide. Comparable results from these modified IL-2 signal peptides were found to increase AP levels in the medium from bovine aortic endothelial cells. Moreover, the combined changes in basic and hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide augmented serum levels of endostatin and placental AP by 3-fold when the optimal plasmid constructs were injected in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Modification of the IL-2 signal peptide augments protein secretion both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, optimizing the signal peptide should be considered for increasing the therapeutic levels of secreted proteins.},

   journal = {Molecular Informatics},
   volume = {33},
   pages = {230-239},
   abstract = {Fast and effective prediction of signal peptides (SP) and their cleavage sites is of great importance in computational biology. The approaches developed to predict signal peptide can be roughly divided into machine learning based, and sliding windows based. In order to further increase the prediction accuracy and coverage of organism for SP cleavage sites, we propose a novel method for predicting SP cleavage sites called Signal-CTF that utilizes machine learning and sliding windows, and is designed for N-termial secretory proteins in a large variety of organisms including human, animal, plant, virus, bacteria, fungi and archaea. Signal-CTF consists of three distinct elements: (1) a subsite-coupled and regularization function with a scaled window of fixed width that selects a set of candidates of possible secretion-cleavable segment for a query secretory protein; (2) a sum fusion system that integrates the outcomes from aligning the cleavage site template sequence with each of the aforementioned candidates in a scaled window of fixed width to determine the best candidate cleavage sites for the query secretory protein; (3) a voting system that identifies the ultimate signal peptide cleavage site among all possible results derived from using scaled windows of different width. When compared with Signal-3L and SignalP 4.0 predictors, the prediction accuracy of Signal-CTF is 4–12 %, 10–25 % higher than that of Signal-3L for human, animal and eukaryote, and SignalP 4.0 for eukaryota, Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Comparing with PRED-SIGNAL and SignalP 4.0 predictors on the 32 archaea secretory proteins of used in Bagos’s paper, the prediction accuracy of Signal-CTF is 12.5 %, 25 % higher than that of PRED-SIGNAL and SignalP 4.0, respectively. The predicting results of several long signal peptides show that the Signal-CTF can better predict cleavage sites for long signal peptides than SignalP, Phobius, Philius, SPOCTOPUS, Signal-CF and Signal-3L. These results show that Signal-CTF is more accurate and flexible in predicting signal peptides of different characteristics for many organisms.

As the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the postgenomic era, the challenge of identifying new signal sequences has become even more urgent and critical in biomedical engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel predictor called Signal-BNF to predict the N-terminal signal peptide as well as its cleavage site based on Bayesian reasoning network. Signal-BNF is formed by fusing the results of different Bayesian classifiers which used different feature datasets as its input through weighted voting system. Experiment results show that Signal-BNF is superior to the popular online predictors such as Signal-3L and PrediSi. Signal-BNF is featured by high prediction accuracy that may serve as a useful tool for further investigating many unclear details regarding the molecular mechanism of the zip code protein-sorting system in cells.},

   abstract = {Human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (hHint1) is a member of a ubiquitous and ancient branch of the histidine triad protein superfamily. hHint1 is a homodimeric protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of model substrates, phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate, with a high efficiency. Recently, catalytically inactive hHint1 has been identified as the cause of inherited peripheral neuropathy [Zimon, M., et al. (2012) Nat. Genet. 44, 1080-1083]. We have conducted the first detailed kinetic mechanistic studies of hHint1 and have found that the reaction mechanism is consistent with a double-displacement mechanism, in which the active site nucleophile His112 is first adenylylated by the substrate, followed by hydrolysis of the AMP-enzyme intermediate. A transient burst phase followed by a linear phase from the stopped-flow fluorescence assay indicated that enzyme adenylylation was faster than the subsequent intermediate hydrolysis and product release. Solvent viscosity experiments suggested that both chemical transformation and diffusion-sensitive events (product release or protein conformational change) limit the overall turnover. The catalytic trapping experiments and data simulation indicated that the true koff rate of the final product AMP is unlikely to control the overall kcat. Therefore, a protein conformational change associated with product release is likely rate-limiting. In addition, the rate of Hint1 adenylylation was found to be dependent on two residues with pKa values of 6.5 and 8, with the former pKa agreeing well with the nuclear magnetic resonance titration results for the pKa of the active site nucleophile His112. In comparison to the uncatalyzed rates, hHint1 was shown to enhance acyl-AMP and AMP phosphoramidate hydrolysis by 10(6)-10(8)-fold. Taken together, our analysis indicates that hHint1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate with high efficiency, through a mechanism that relies on rapid adenylylation of the active residue, His112, while being partially rate-limited by intermediate hydrolysis and product release associated with a conformational change. Given the high degree of sequence homology of Hint proteins across all kingdoms of life, it is likely that their kinetic and catalytic mechanisms will be similar to those elucidated for hHint1.},

   abstract = {The gene responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) has been recently identified to code for a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase, BTK), required for normal B cell development. BTK, like many other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, contains Src homology domains (SH2 and SH3), and catalytic kinase domain. SH3 domains are important for the targeting of signaling molecules to specific subcellular locations. We have identified a family with XLA whose affected members have a point mutation (g-->a) at the 5' splice site of intron 8, resulting in the skipping of coding exon 8 and loss of 21 amino acids forming the COOH-terminal portion of the BTK SH3 domain. The study of three generations within this kinship, using restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA analysis, allowed identification of the mutant X chromosome responsible for XLA and the carrier status in this family. BTK mRNA was present in normal amounts in Epstein-Barr virus-induced B lymphoblastoid cell lines established from affected family members. Although the SH3 deletion did not alter BTK protein stability and kinase activity of the truncated BTK protein was normal, the affected patients nevertheless have a severe B cell defect characteristic for XLA. The mutant protein was modeled using the normal BTK SH3 domain. The deletion results in loss of two COOH-terminal beta strands containing several residues critical for the formation of the putative SH3 ligand-binding pocket. We predict that, as a result, one or more crucial SH3 binding proteins fail to interact with BTK, interrupting the cytoplasmic signal transduction process required for B cell differentiation.},
