  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of a rapid diagnostic test for malaria
	(RDTm) allows accurate diagnosis at all levels of health facilities.
	The objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety of
	withholding antimalarials in febrile children who have a negative
	test result. METHODS: We conducted a prospective 2-arm longitudinal
	study in areas of Tanzania that are moderately and highly endemic
	for malaria. Children with a history of fever were managed routinely
	by resident clinicians of 2 health facilities, except that no antimalarials
	were prescribed if the RDTm result was negative. Children were followed
	up at home on day 7. The main outcome was the occurrence of complications
	in children with negative RDTm results; children with positive RDTm
	results were followed up for the same outcomes for indirect comparison.
	RESULTS: One thousand children (median age, 24 months) were recruited.
	Six hundred three children (60%) had a negative RDTm result. Five
	hundred seventy-three (97%) of these children were cured on day 7.
	Forty-nine (8%) of the children with negative RDTm results spontaneously
	visited the dispensary before day 7, compared with 10 (3%) of the
	children with positive RDTm results. All children who had negative
	initial results had negative results again when they were tested
	either at spontaneous attendance or on day 7 because they were not
	cured clinically, except for 3 who gave positive results on days
	2, 4, and 7 respectively but who did not experience any complication.
	Four children who had negative initial results were admitted to the
	hospital subsequently, all with negative results for malaria tests
	upon admission. Two of them died, of causes other than malaria. CONCLUSIONS:
	Not giving antimalarial drugs in febrile children who had a negative
	RDTm result was safe, even in an area highly endemic for malaria.
	Our study provides evidence for treatment recommendations based on
	parasitological diagnosis in children <5 years old.},

	molecular markers for prognostication of CLL patients, we analyzed
	cDNA arrays by using hierarchical clustering and standard statistic

	associated with CLL patients with the 11q23 deletion. Many of the
	genes in the cluster have not previously been shown to be related
	to the initiation or progression of CLL. These novel findings provide

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Malaria is still a public health problem in Sub-Saharan
	Africa. Malaria causes mortality mostly in children under-five years.
	Early detection and prompt treatment using recommended antimalarials
	is key to malaria control. However, in Tanzania, contrary to the
	national goals, a large proportion of children with fever taken to
	health facilities are not tested for malaria and those tested positive
	are not promptly treated using recommended antimalarials. The aim
	of this study was to determine factors associated with malaria testing
	and prompt use of recommended antimalarials among under-five children
	with fever in Tanzania. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of
	Tanzania HIV and Malaria Indicator Survey (THMIS) data 2011-12 obtained
	from a national cross sectional survey. The analysis involved children
	aged 6-59 months whose mothers reported they had fever two weeks
	preceding the survey. Factors associated with testing and uses of
	recommended antimalarials were obtained using logistic regression.
	RESULTS: Of the 1675 under-five children with fever, 951 (56.8%)
	were taken to the health facilities. Of the 951 children, only 394
	(41.48%) febrile children were tested for malaria. Of those tested,
	291 (78.91%) were diagnosed with malaria. Of those diagnosed with
	malaria, only 124 (42.68%) children used recommended antimalarials
	within 1st 24 hours of diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, children
	taken to health centers (OR 1.79; 95%CI: 1.07-3.00) and to the hospitals
	(OR 3.4; 95%CI: 1.75-6.77) had higher odds of being tested compared
	to those taken to dispensary and other lower level health facilities.
	Children were more likely to use recommended antimalarial promptly
	if they had a caretaker with secondary or higher education (OR: 4.07;
	95%CI: 0.61-2.68) or living in the rural area (OR: 3.21; 95%CI: 1.09-9.44)
	compared to those with an uneducated caretaker or from an urban area.
	CONCLUSION: Training on malaria testing and treatment guidelines
	should be provided, and preventing stock outs of malaria testing
	kits and medications at dispensary level should be made available
	as it is the first point of health care for most Tanzanians. Reasons
	on why urban people are less likely to use recommended antimalarials
	need to be investigated and addressed for proper malaria management.}

  abstract = {The assessment of residue conservation in a multiple sequence alignment
	is a central issue in bioinformatics. Conserved residues and regions
	are used to determine structural and functional motifs or evolutionary

	For this reason, residue conservation is a valuable measure for database
	and motif search or for estimating the quality of alignments. In
	this paper, we present statistical methods for identifying conserved
	residues in multiple sequence alignments. While most earlier studies
	examine the positional conservation of the alignment, we focus on
	the detection of individual conserved residues at a position. The
	major advantages of multiple comparison methods originate from their
	ability to select conserved residues simultaneously and to consider
	the variability of the residue estimates. Large-scale simulations
	were used for the comparative analysis of the methods. Practical
	performance was studied by comparing the structurally and functionally
	important residues of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains to the assignments
	of the conservation indices. The applicability of the indices was
	also compared in three additional protein families comprising different
	degrees of entropy and variability in alignment positions. The results

	One of the drawbacks of the hidden Markov model is that the conserved

	is often enormous. Focusing the analysis on conserved residues only
	should increase the accuracy of sequence database search. RESULTS:
	We address this issue with a new method for efficient emission probability
	(EEP) estimation, in which amino acids are divided into effective
	and ineffective residues at each conserved alignment position. A
	practical study with 20 protein families demonstrated that the EEP
	method is capable of detecting family members from other proteins
	with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 99% on the average, even
	if the number of free emission parameters was decreased to 15% of
	the original. In the database search for TIM barrel sequences, EEP
	recognizes the family members nearly as accurately as HMMER or Blast,

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an essential prerequisite
	for many sequence analysis methods and valuable tool itself for describing

	measures for assessing the quality of alignments are highly requisite.
	RESULTS: We present a statistical model-based alignment quality score.
	Unlike other quality scores, it does not require several parallel
	alignments for the same set of sequences or additional structural
	information. Our quality score is based on measuring the conservation
	level of reference alignments in Homstrad. Reference sequences were
	realigned with the Mafft, Muscle and Probcons alignment programs,
	and a sum-of-pairs (SP) score was used to measure the quality of
	the realignments. Statistical modelling of the SP score as a function
	of conservation level and other alignment characteristics makes it
	possible to predict the SP score for any global MSA. The predicted
	SP scores are highly correlated with the correct SP scores, when
	tested on the Homstrad and SABmark databases. The results are comparable
	to that of multiple overlap score (MOS) and better than those of
	normalized mean distance (NorMD) and normalized iRMSD (NiRMSD) alignment

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment is the foundation of many
	important applications in bioinformatics that aim at detecting functionally
	important regions, predicting protein structures, building phylogenetic
	trees etc. Although the automatic construction of a multiple sequence
	alignment for a set of remotely related sequences cause a very challenging
	and error-prone task, many downstream analyses still rely heavily
	on the accuracy of the alignments. RESULTS: To address the need for
	an objective evaluation framework, we introduce a statistical score
	that assesses the quality of a given multiple sequence alignment.
	The quality assessment is based on counting the number of significantly
	conserved positions in the alignment using importance sampling method
	in conjunction with statistical profile analysis framework. We first
	evaluate a novel objective function used in the alignment quality
	score for measuring the positional conservation. The results for
	the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, Ras-like proteins, peptidase M13,
	subtilase and beta-lactamase families demonstrate that the score
	can distinguish sequence patterns with different degrees of conservation.
	Secondly, we evaluate the quality of the alignments produced by several
	widely used multiple sequence alignment programs using a novel alignment
	quality score and a commonly used sum of pairs method. According
	to these results, the Mafft strategy L-INS-i outperforms the other
	methods, although the difference between the Probcons, TCoffee and
	Muscle is mostly insignificant. The novel alignment quality score
	provides similar results than the sum of pairs method. CONCLUSION:
	The results indicate that the proposed statistical score is useful

  abstract = {Many proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions, which may
	be crucial for function, but on the other hand be related to the
	pathogenicity of variants. Prediction programs have been developed
	to detect disordered regions from sequences and used to predict the
	consequences of variants, although their performance for this task
	has not been assessed. We tested the performance of protein disorder
	prediction programs in detecting changes to disorder caused by amino
	acid substitutions. We assessed the performance of 29 protein disorder
	predictors and versions with 101 amino acid substitutions, whose
	effects have been experimentally validated. Disorder predictors detected
	the true positives at most with 6% success rate and true negatives
	with 34% rate for variants. The corresponding rates for the wild-type
	forms are 7% and 90%, respectively. The analysis revealed that disorder
	programs cannot reliably predict the effects of substitutions; consequently,
	the tested methods, and possibly similar programs, cannot be recommended
	for variant analysis without other information indicating to the
	relevance of disorder. These results inspired us to develop a new
	method, PON-Diso (http://structure.bmc.lu.se/PON-Diso), for disorder-related
	amino acid substitutions. With 50% success rate for independent test
	set and 70.5% rate in cross-validation, it outperforms the evaluated

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) has been available
	for over two decades and has a proven record of efficacy, it is very
	expensive to produce and can only be made in small quantities. METHODS:
	In this trial, we compared the safety and immunogenicity of a new,
	chromatographically purified rabies vaccine (CPRV) with those of
	HDCV. One hundred and thirty-five healthy veterinary students were
	randomized in a 2:1 ratio between CPRV and HDCV respectively. Each
	student subsequently received an intramuscular injection of 0.5 mL
	of CPRV or 1mL of HDCV on days 0, 7, and 28, according to the standard
	preexposure regimen. Local safety data were collected for 7 days
	following each dose and systemic safety data for 42 days following
	the first dose. Vaccine administration and safety evaluation were
	performed by different site personnel. Sera for immunogenicity analysis
	were collected on days 0 (prevaccination), 28 and 42. RESULTS: All
	subjects achieved an antirabies antibody titer greater than or equal
	to the World Health Organization (WHO) accepted threshold level of
	seroconversion of 0.5 IU/mL after only two of three doses of vaccine
	in both groups. The geometric mean titers (IU/mL) in the CPRV and
	HDCV groups respectively were 6.54 (range 0.50 to 64.80) and 10.22
	(range 0.70 to 51.40) on day 28, and 40.51 (range 5.40 to 278.00)
	and 37.71 (range 5.40 to 278.00) on day 42. The percentage of subjects
	experiencing local reactions within 3 days after any dose ranged
	from 65.2% to 80.9% in the CPRV group and from 77.3% to 84.4% in
	the HDCV group. The local reaction reported by the greatest percentage
	of subjects after each dose was pain/tenderness at the injection
	site, and most reactions were mild. Most of the reported local reactions
	resolved within 0 to 3 days postvaccination. Systemic reactions decreased
	from 76.4% after dose 1 to 36.0% after dose 3 in the CPRV group,
	and similarly from 55.6% to 31.8% in the HDCV group. For all postdose
	periods, the systemic reaction reported by the highest percentage
	of subjects was myalgia. No subjects experienced an immediate local
	or systemic reaction. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adults, vaccination
	with CPRV using a preexposure schedule resulted in a safety and immunogenicity
	profile similar to that of HDCV.},

  abstract = {The site specificity that avian Eimeria sporozoites and, to a more
	limited degree, other apicomplexan parasites exhibit for invasion
	in vivo suggests that specific interactions between the sporozoites
	and the target host cells may mediate the invasion process. Although
	sporozoite motility and structural and secreted antigens appear to
	provide the mechanisms for propelling the sporozoite into the host
	cell,there is a growing body of evidence that the host cell provides
	characteristics by which the sporozoites recognise and interact with
	the host cell as a prelude to invasion. Molecules on the surface
	of cells in the intestinal epithelium, that act as receptor or recognition
	sites for sporozoite invasion, may be included among these characteristics.
	The existence of receptor molecules for invasion by apicomplexan
	parasites was suggested by in vitro studies in which parasite invasion
	was inhibited in cultured cells that were treated with a variety
	of substances designed to selectively alter the host cell membrane.
	These substance included cationic compounds or molecules, enzymes
	that cleave specific linkages, protease inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,
	etc. More specific evidence for the presence of receptors was provided
	by the binding of parasite antigens to specific host cell surface
	molecules. Analyses of host cells have implicated 22, 31, and 37
	kDa antigens, surface membrane glycoconjugates,conserved epitopes
	of host cells and sporozoites, etc., but no treatment that perturbs
	these putative receptors has completely inhibited invasion of the
	cells by parasites. Regardless of the mechanism,sporozoites of the
	avian Eimeria also invade the same specific sites in foreign host
	birds that they invade in the natural host. Thus, site specificity
	for invasion may be a response to characteristics of the intestine
	that are shared by a number of hosts rather than to a unique trait
	of the natural host. Protective immunity elicited against avian Eimeria
	species is not manifested in a total blockade of parasite invasion.
	In fact, the effect of immunity on invasion differs according to
	the eliciting species and depends upon the area of the intestine
	that is invaded. Immunity produced against caecal species of avian
	Eimeria, for example Eimeria tenella and Eimeria adenoeides, inhibits
	subsequent invasion by homologous or heterologous challenge species,
	regardless of the area of the intestine that the challenge species
	invade. Conversely, in birds immunised with upper intestinal species,
	Eimeria acervulina and Eimeria meleagrimitis, invasion by challenge
	species is not decreased and often is significantly increased.},

	formalin-fixed BHK, CC, turkey cecal (TC) cells, and PTK. Pretreatment
	of BHK cells with MAb 1209-C2 significantly reduced invasion of the
	cells by sporozoites of E. tenella, E. acervulina, E. meleagrimitis,
	and C. bigenetica, but did not alter invasion by T. gondii, C. parvum,
	or H. hammondia. Apparently, reactivity of MAB 1209-C2 with the sporozoites
	was required for inhibition of invasion despite the fact that the
	inhibition resulted from pre-treatment of the host cell. Conversely,
	although MAb 1209-C2 also reacted moderately with PTK and TC cells,
	pre-treatment of these cell cultures with the MAb did not inhibit
	invasion by either MAB 1209-C2-reactive or -nonreactive parasites.
	Collectively, the data indicated that refractile body antigens of
	sporozoites of Eimeria and Caryospora, which are recognized by MAb
	1209-C2, may function in cellular invasion, but also suggest that
	cellular invasion is probably not mediated by interactions between
	the conserved epitopes in sporozoites and cultured host cells that
	are recognized by the MAb.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},

  volume = {7},
  pages = {178},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction
	has been improving steadily towards the 88% estimated theoretical
	limit. There are two types of prediction algorithms: Single-sequence
	prediction algorithms imply that information about other (homologous)
	proteins is not available, while algorithms of the second type imply
	that information about homologous proteins is available, and use
	it intensively. The single-sequence algorithms could make an important
	contribution to studies of proteins with no detected homologs, however
	the accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction from a single-sequence
	is not as high as when the additional evolutionary information is
	present.RESULTS:In this paper, we further refine and extend the hidden
	semi-Markov model (HSMM) initially considered in the BSPSS algorithm.
	We introduce an improved residue dependency model by considering
	the patterns of statistically significant amino acid correlation
	at structural segment borders. We also derive models that specialize
	on different sections of the dependency structure and incorporate
	them into HSMM. In addition, we implement an iterative training method
	to refine estimates of HSMM parameters. The three-state-per-residue
	accuracy and other accuracy measures of the new method, IPSSP, are
	shown to be comparable or better than ones for BSPSS as well as for
	PSIPRED, tested under the single-sequence condition.CONCLUSIONS:We
	have shown that new dependency models and training methods bring
	further improvements to single-sequence protein secondary structure
	prediction. The results are obtained under cross-validation conditions
	using a dataset with no pair of sequences having significant sequence
	similarity. As new sequences are added to the database it is possible
	to augment the dependency structure and obtain even higher accuracy.
	Current and future advances should contribute to the improvement
	of function prediction for orphan proteins inscrutable to current
	similarity search methods.},

	of locomotion termed gliding motility to invade host cells and cross
	cell substrates. This amoeboid-like movement uses a parasite adhesin

	a set of proteins linking the extracellular adhesin, via an actin-myosin

	have nearly identical tertiary structures and are related by approximate
	2-fold symmetry, but lack internal amino acid sequence homology.
	Comparison of the core domain structure with known structures by

	that the CDA tertiary structure cannot be superimposed on any known
	protein structure. The two active sites per dimer are formed across
	the subunit interface. The N-terminal core domain provides a pyrimidine
	nucleoside and zinc-binding pocket and the structurally homologous
	C-terminal core domain in the other monomer covers this active-site
	cleft, completely sequestering the ligand from solvent. The deeply
	buried zinc-binding site is formed by a novel "topological switch
	point" at the amino termini of two alpha-helices in consecutive alpha-beta-alpha-beta
	segments. The transition state analog is bound as a covalent hydrate
	at C4. The inhibitor hydroxyl oxygen atom interacts both with the
	zinc atom and the Glu104 carboxylate group, affording high differential
	affinity for the hydroxyl group relative to a hydrogen atom, in a
	manner reminiscent of that observed in adenosine deaminase (ADA).
	Unlike the latter enzyme, the zinc atom is coordinated in a tetrahedral

	hydroxyl group. Moreover, the inhibitor stereochemistry is of the

	functions involved in generating the zinc hydroxide nucleophile,
	and protonating the pyrimidine ring nitrogen atom and leaving amino

	The similarity significance threshold needed in the clustering method
	was found by analyzing similarities of random sequences. Because
	three dimensional structures for proteins of same structural class
	are generally more conserved than their sequences, the proteins were
	clustered also according to their contents of secondary structural
	elements. The results of these clusterings indicate conservation
	of alpha- and beta-structures even when sequence similarity is relatively
	low. An unbiased sample of 103 high resolution structures, representing
	a wide variety of proteins, was chosen based on the suggestions made
	by the clustering algorithm. The proteins were divided into structural
	classes according to their contents and ratios of secondary structural
	elements. Previous classifications have suffered from subjective
	view of secondary structures, whereas here the classification was
	based on backbone geometry. The concise view lead to reclassification
	of some structures. The representative set of structures facilitates
	unbiased analyses of relationships between protein sequence, function,

	stages responsible for onward transmission to mosquitoes. An existing
	gametocyte parasitic lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) assay was adapted
	for use in 384-well plates, and a novel homogeneous immunoassay to
	monitor the functional transition of female gametocytes into gametes
	was developed. A collection of 48 marketed and experimental antimalarials
	was screened and subsequently tested for impact on sporogony in Anopheles
	mosquitoes, to directly quantify the transmission-blocking properties
	of antimalarials in relation to their effects on gametocyte pLDH
	activity or gametogenesis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The novel screening
	assays revealed distinct stage-specific kinetics and dynamics of
	drug effects. Peroxides showed the most potent transmission-blocking
	effects, with an intermediate speed of action and IC50 values that
	were 20-40-fold higher than the IC50s against the asexual stages

	in 50 mM Bicine and 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, pH 8.3, at 30.0 degrees C by following
	a decrease in the protein's intrinsic fluorescence. In the presence
	of 50 mM NaOAc, but in the absence of added creatine or nitrate,
	MgADP has an apparent K(d) of 135 +/- 7 microM, and the total change

	the formation of a CK.MgADP.anion.creatine transition-state analogue
	complex (TSAC) [Millner-White and Watts (1971) Biochem. J. 122, 727-740].
	In the presence of 80 mM creatine, but no nitrate, the apparent K(d)
	for MgADP remains essentially unchanged at 132 +/- 10 microM, while
	Delta%F decreases slightly to 13.2 +/- 0.3%. In the presence of 10

	+/- 0.7 microM, and Delta%F increases to 20.6 +/- 0.3%, strongly
	suggesting that the simultaneous presence of saturating levels of
	creatine and nitrate increases the affinity of CK for MgADP and promotes
	the formation of the enzyme*MgADP*nitrate*creatine TSAC. When the
	fluorescence of CK was titrated with MgADP in the presence of 80
	mM creatine and fixed saturating concentrations of various anions,
	apparent K(d) values for MgADP of 132 +/- 10 microM, 25.2 +/- 1.3
	microM, 18.8 +/- 0.9 microM, 13.7 +/- 0.7 microM, and 6.4 +/- 0.7
	microM were observed as the anion was changed from acetate to formate
	to chloride to nitrate to nitrite, respectively. This is the same
	trend reported by Millner-White and Watts for the effectiveness of
	various monovalent anions in forming the CK.MgADP.anion.creatine
	TSAC. On titration of CK with MgADP in the presence of 80 mM creatine
	and various fixed concentrations of NaNO3, the apparent K(d) for
	MgADP decreases with increasing fixed concentrations of nitrate.
	A plot of the apparent K(d) for MgADP vs [NO3-] suggests a K(d) for
	nitrate from the TSAC of 0.39 +/- 0.07 mM. Similarly, titration with
	MgADP in the presence of 10 mM NaNO3 and various fixed concentrations
	of creatine gives a value of 0.9 +/- 0.4 mM for the dissociation
	of creatine from the TSAC. The data were used to calculate K(TDAC),
	the dissociation constant of the quaternary TSAC into its individual
	components, of 3 x 10(-10) M3. To our knowledge this is the first
	reported dissociation constant for a ternary or quaternary TSAC.},

	All the other compounds blocked hERG, with IC(50)s ranging from 3-

	effects of chloroquine at about 30-fold its C(max) were confirmed
	and DHA blocked it at a concentration about 300-fold its C(max).
	In rabbit heart ventricular preparations, dofetilide, used as a positive
	control, revealed a high risk of torsades de pointes, whereas chloroquine
	showed a medium risk. Neither DHA-PQP nor artemether-lumefantrine
	displayed an in vitro signal for a significant proarrhythmic risk.
	Only chloroquine blocked the I(Na) ion current and did so at about
	30-fold its C(max). No effect on I(Ks) was detected. In conclusion,

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Parasitological confirmation of malaria prior to treatment
	is recommended for patients of all ages, with malaria rapid diagnostic
	tests (mRDTs) an important tool to target artemisinin-based combination
	therapies (ACTs) to patients with malaria. To evaluate the impact
	on case management practices of routine government implementation
	of mRDTs, we conducted large-scale health facility surveys in three
	regions of Tanzania before and after mRDT roll-out. METHODS: Febrile
	patients at randomly selected health facilities were interviewed
	about care received at the facility, and blood samples were collected
	for reference blood smears. Health facility staff were interviewed
	about their qualifications and availability of malaria diagnostics
	and drugs. RESULTS: The percentage of febrile patients tested for
	malaria at the facility increased from 15.8% in 2010 to 54.9% in
	2012. ACTs were obtained by 65.8% of patients positive by reference
	blood smear in 2010 and by 50.2% in 2012 (P = 0.0675); no antimalarial
	was obtained by 57.8% of malaria-negative patients in 2010 and by
	82.3% in 2012 (P < 0.0001). Overall, ACT use decreased (39.9-21.3%,
	P < 0.0001) and antibiotic use increased (31.2-48.5%, P < 0.0001).
	CONCLUSION: Roll-out of mRDTs in Tanzania dramatically improved diagnostic
	testing for malaria and reduced overuse of ACTs for patients without
	parasitemia. However, post-roll-out almost 50% of febrile patients
	did not receive a diagnostic test, and almost 50% of patients testing
	positive did not receive ACTs. Stock-outs of ACTs and mRDTs were
	important problems. Further investigation is needed to determine
	reasons for not providing ACTs to patients with malaria and potential
	for inappropriate antibiotic use.},

	including the glycosidic bond. In contrast with the normal substrate
	cytidine (kcat/Km = 2.6 x 10(6) M-1 s-1), cytosine is found to serve
	as an extremely slow substrate (kcat/Km = 1.8 x 10(-3) M-1 s-1),
	despite the ability of cytosine to enter any active site that can
	accommodate the normal substrate cytidine. Spontaneous nonenzymatic
	deamination proceeds at similar rates for cytosine and cytidine at
	pH 7 and 25 degrees C, indicating that substituent ribose exerts
	little effect on the intrinsic reactivity of cytidine in solution.
	Dividing knon by kcat/Km, the maximal Kd value of the enzyme's complex
	with the altered substrate in the transition state is estimated as
	6.1 x 10(-8) M for cytosine, very much higher than the value (1.2
	x 10(-16) M) estimated for cytidine. The Kd value of ribofuranose,
	the missing substituent, is roughly 1.8 x 10(-2) M, as indicated
	by the Ki values of D-ribose and 1-methyl-D-ribofuranoside as competitive

	plus ribofuranose. As a separate molecule, however, ribose shows

	effects of similar magnitude are indicated by the equilibrium binding
	affinities of inhibitors. Thus, the Ki value of the transition state

	lower than the combined affinities of N-ribofuranosylurea (1.6 x

	After purification from an overexpressing strain, the enzyme from

	A region of amino acid sequence homology, containing residues that

	between Glu-91 and the 3'-OH group of substituent ribose, a part
	of the substrate that is not directly involved in its chemical transformation.
	To test the contribution of this interaction to transition-state
	stabilization, Glu-91 was converted to alanine. The mutant enzyme
	is very much less active than the wild-type enzyme, with a 500-fold
	increase in Km and a 32-fold reduction in kcat using cytidine as
	substrate. No change in secondary structure is evident in the circular
	dichroic spectrum. As measured by kcat/Km, Glu-91 thus appears to
	stabilize the transition state for cytidine deamination by an overall
	factor of 1.7 x 10(4), equivalent to -5.8 kcal/mol in free energy.
	To test the contribution of this interaction in the opposite sense,
	the 3'-OH group of the substrate was replaced by a hydrogen atom.
	Comparing 3'-deoxycytidine with cytidine, the native enzyme shows
	a 17-fold increase in Km and a 400-fold decrease in kcat, indicating
	that the 3'-hydroxyl group of cytidine stabilizes the transition

	E91A, removal of the 3'-hydroxyl group from substrate cytidine reduces
	kcat/Km by a factor of only 3. Complete removal of substituent ribose
	reduces the wild-type enzyme's kcat/Km by a factor of more than 10(8);
	thus, substituent ribose, although distant from the site of chemical
	transformation of the substrate, contributes at least 11 kcal to
	the free energy of stabilization of the transition state for cytidine
	deamination, matching the apparent contribution to transition state
	binding made by the 4-OH group of the pyrimidine ring, which is at

	site were identified (Ikegawa, S., Nakamura, K., Nagano, A., Haga,
	N., and Nakamura, Y. (1997) Hum. Mutat. 9, 131–135). To study their
	impact on collagen X biosynthesis using in vitrocell-free translation
	in the presence of microsomes, and cell transfection assays, these
	two mutations were created inCOL10A1 by site-directed mutagenesis.
	The data suggest that translocation of the mutant pre-α1(X) chains
	into the microsomes is not affected, but cleavage of the signal peptide
	is inhibited, and the mutant chains remain anchored to the membrane
	of microsomes. Cell-free translation and transfection studies in
	cells showed that the mutant chains associate into trimers but cannot
	form a triple helix. The combined effect of both the lack of signal
	peptide cleavage and helical configuration is impaired secretion.
	Thus, despite the different nature of the NC1 and signal peptide
	mutations in collagen X, both result in impaired collagen X secretion,
	probably followed by intracellular retention and degradation of mutant
	chains, and causing the Schmid metaphyseal chandrodysplasia phenotype.}

	CLE, according to smoking status. The strength of association between
	smoking and cutaneous response rate was expressed using the odds

	10 studies met inclusion criteria, for a total of 1398 patients.
	The pooled odds ratio for the response to antimalarials in smoker

	The recent crystal structure of the complete ectoplasmic region of

	domains and that the first two domains are based on the PAN folding
	motif. Here, we discuss the consequences of this analysis for the
	three-dimensional structure of AMA1 from other Plasmodium species
	and other apicomplexan parasites, and for the Plasmodium paralogue
	MAEBL. Many polar and apolar interactions observed in the PvAMA1
	crystal structure are made by residues that are invariant or highly
	conserved throughout all Plasmodium orthologues; a subgroup of these
	residues is also present in other apicomplexan orthologues and in
	MAEBL. These interactions presumably play a key role in defining
	the protein fold. Previous studies have shown that the ectoplasmic
	region of AMA1 must be cleaved from the parasite surface for host-cell
	invasion to proceed. The cleavage site in the crystal structure is
	not readily accessible to proteases and we discuss possible consequences
	of this observation. The three-dimensional distribution of polymorphic
	sites in PfAMA1 shows that these are all on the surface and that
	their positions are significantly biased to one side of the ectoplasmic
	region. Of particular note, a flexible segment in domain II, comprising
	about 40 residues and devoid of polymorphism, carries an epitope
	recognized by an invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibody and a T-cell
	epitope implicated in the human immune response to AMA1.},

	precursor proteins to the correct subcellular compartments in prokaryotes

	the medical, food and beverage and biotechnology industries yet our
	understanding of these peptides remains limited. This paper examines
	the most common type of signal peptides cleavable by the endoprotease
	signal peptidase I (SPase I), and the residues flanking the cleavage
	sites of three groups of signal peptide sequences, namely (i) eukaryotes
	(Euk) (ii) Gram-positive (Gram+) bacteria, and (iii) Gram-negative
	(Gram-) bacteria.RESULTS:In this study, 2352 secretory peptide sequences
	from a variety of organisms with amino-terminal SPs are extracted
	from the manually curated SPdb database for analysis based on physicochemical
	properties such as pI, aliphatic index, GRAVY score, hydrophobicity,
	net charge and position-specific residue preferences. Our findings
	show that the three groups share several similarities in general,
	but they display distinctive features upon examination in terms of
	their amino acid compositions and frequencies, and various physico-chemical
	properties. Thus, analysis or prediction of their sequences should
	be separated and treated as distinct groups.CONCLUSION:We conclude
	that the peptide segment recognized by SPase I extends to the start
	of the mature protein to a limited extent, upon our survey of the
	amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage processing site. These
	flanking residues possibly influence the cleavage processing and
	contribute to non-canonical cleavage sites. Our findings are applicable

	for predicting the cleavage sites in proteins by HIV protease. Various
	prediction models or algorithms have been developed during the past
	5 years. This Review is devoted to addressing the following problems:
	(1) Why is it important to predict the cleavability of a peptide
	by HIV protease? (2) What progresses have been made in developing
	the prediction methods, and what merits and weakness does each of
	these methods carry? The attention is focused on the state-of-the-art,
	which is featured by a discriminant function algorithm developed
	very recently as well as an improved database (the program and database
	are available upon request) established according to new experimental
	results.},

  abstract = {Current plant genome sequencing projects have called for development
	of novel and powerful high throughput tools for timely annotating
	the subcellular location of uncharacterized plant proteins. In view
	of this, an ensemble classifier, Plant-PLoc, formed by fusing many
	basic individual classifiers, has been developed for large-scale
	subcellular location prediction for plant proteins. Each of the basic
	classifiers was engineered by the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) rule.
	Plant-PLoc discriminates plant proteins among the following 11 subcellular
	locations: (1) cell wall, (2) chloroplast, (3) cytoplasm, (4) endoplasmic
	reticulum, (5) extracell, (6) mitochondrion, (7) nucleus, (8) peroxisome,
	(9) plasma membrane, (10) plastid, and (11) vacuole. As a demonstration,
	predictions were performed on a stringent benchmark dataset in which
	none of the proteins included has > or =25% sequence identity to
	any other in a same subcellular location to avoid the homology bias.
	The overall success rate thus obtained was 32-51% higher than the
	rates obtained by the previous methods on the same benchmark dataset.
	The essence of Plant-PLoc in enhancing the prediction quality and
	its significance in biological applications are discussed. Plant-PLoc
	is accessible to public as a free web-server at: (http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/plant).
	Furthermore, for public convenience, results predicted by Plant-PLoc
	have been provided in a downloadable file at the same website for
	all plant protein entries in the Swiss-Prot database that do not
	have subcellular location annotations, or are annotated as being

  abstract = {Facing the explosion of newly generated protein sequences in the post
	genomic era, we are challenged to develop an automated method for
	fast and reliably annotating their subcellular locations. Knowledge
	of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful hints for
	revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with
	each other in cellular networking. Unfortunately, it is both expensive
	and time-consuming to determine the localization of an uncharacterized
	protein in a living cell purely based on experiments. To tackle the
	challenge, a novel hybridization classifier was developed by fusing
	many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. The "engine"
	of these basic classifiers was operated by the OET-KNN (Optimized
	Evidence-Theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor) rule. As a demonstration,
	predictions were performed with the fusion classifier for proteins
	among the following 16 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole,
	(3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7)
	endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) lysosome,

	(15) plastid, and (16) vacuole. To get rid of redundancy and homology
	bias, none of the proteins investigated here had >/=25% sequence
	identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall
	success rates thus obtained via the jack-knife cross-validation test
	and independent dataset test were 81.6% and 83.7%, respectively,
	which were 46 approximately 63% higher than those performed by the
	other existing methods on the same benchmark datasets. Also, it is
	clearly elucidated that the overwhelmingly high success rates obtained
	by the fusion classifier is by no means a trivial utilization of
	the GO annotations as prone to be misinterpreted because there is
	a huge number of proteins with given accession numbers and the corresponding
	GO numbers, but their subcellular locations are still unknown, and
	that the percentage of proteins with GO annotations indicating their
	subcellular components is even less than the percentage of proteins
	with known subcellular location annotation in the Swiss-Prot database.
	It is anticipated that the powerful fusion classifier may also become
	a very useful high throughput tool in characterizing other attributes
	of proteins according to their sequences, such as enzyme class, membrane
	protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily, among many others.

  abstract = {A protein is usually classified into one of the following five structural

	The structural class of a protein is correlated with its amino acid

	how may one predict its structural class? Various efforts have been
	made in addressing this problem. This review addresses the progress
	in this field, with the focus on the state of the art, which is featured
	by a novel prediction algorithm and a recently developed database.
	The novel algorithm is characterized by a covariance matrix that
	takes into account the coupling effect among different amino acid
	components of a protein. The new database was established based on
	the requirement that the classes should have (1) as many nonhomologous
	structures as possible, (2) good quality structure, and (3) typical
	or distinguishable features for each of the structural classes concerned.
	The very high success rate for both the training-set proteins and
	the testing-set proteins, which has been further validated by a simulated
	analysis and a jackknife analysis, indicates that it is possible
	to predict the structural class of a protein according to its amino
	acid composition if an ideal and complete database can be established.
	It also suggests that the overall fold of a protein is basically

	in animal models and induce apoptosis in sensitive mammalian cells.
	Understanding the cytotoxic propensities of antimalarial drug candidates
	is crucial to their successful development and utilization. Here,
	we demonstrate that, similarly to the model artemisinin artesunate
	(ARS), a synthetic tetraoxane drug candidate (RKA182) and a trioxolane
	equivalent (FBEG100) induce embryotoxicity and depletion of primitive
	erythroblasts in a rodent model. We also show that RKA182, FBEG100

	cell lines, with caspase-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent
	necrosis underlying the induction of cell death. Although the toxic
	effects of RKA182 and FBEG100 proceed more rapidly and are relatively
	less cell-selective than that of ARS, all three compounds are shown
	to be dependent upon heme, iron and oxidative stress for their ability
	to induce cell death. However, in contrast to previously studied
	artemisinins, the toxicity of RKA182 and FBEG100 is shown to be independent

	have shown promise as next-generation antimalarials, the data described
	here indicate that adverse effects associated with artemisinins,
	including embryotoxicity, cannot be ruled out with these novel compounds,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subcellular localization of a new protein sequence is
	very important and fruitful for understanding its function. As the
	number of new genomes has dramatically increased over recent years,
	a reliable and efficient system to predict protein subcellular location
	is urgently needed. RESULTS: Esub8 was developed to predict protein
	subcellular localizations for eukaryotic proteins based on amino
	acid composition. In this research, the proteins are classified into
	the following eight groups: chloroplast, cytoplasm, extracellular,
	Golgi apparatus, lysosome, mitochondria, nucleus and peroxisome.
	We know subcellular localization is a typical classification problem;
	consequently, a one-against-one (1-v-1) multi-class support vector
	machine was introduced to construct the classifier. Unlike previous
	methods, ours considers the order information of protein sequences
	by a different method. Our method is tested in three subcellular
	localization predictions for prokaryotic proteins and four subcellular
	localization predictions for eukaryotic proteins on Reinhardt's dataset.
	The results are then compared to several other methods. The total
	prediction accuracies of two tests are both 100% by a self-consistency
	test, and are 92.9% and 84.14% by the jackknife test, respectively.
	Esub8 also provides excellent results: the total prediction accuracies
	are 100% by a self-consistency test and 87% by the jackknife test.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our method represents a different approach for predicting
	protein subcellular localization and achieved a satisfactory result;
	furthermore, we believe Esub8 will be a useful tool for predicting
	protein subcellular localizations in eukaryotic organisms.},

	in vitro growth-inhibiting properties towards drug-sensitive D6 and
	drug-resistant C235 strains of Plasmodium falciparum as well as inhibiting

	and 5d (IC50: 93.5 ng/mL) emerged as lead molecules that inhibit
	liver stage Plasmodium berghei and are significantly more potent
	than chloroquine (IC50: >2000 ng/mL) and mefloquine (IC50: >2000
	ng/mL) in this screen. All the compounds that showed potent inhibitory
	activity against the P. berghei liver stage were nontoxic to human
	HepG2 liver cells (IC50: >2000 ng/mL). The compounds 5a and 5b exhibit
	comparable metabolic stability as chloroquine and mefloquine in human
	plasma and the most potent compound 5d demonstrated suitable permeability
	characteristics using the MDCK monolayer. These results emphasize
	the value of 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidones as novel antimalarials
	for further drug development.},

	chemotherapy, progressive disease was established in all patients
	by use of WHO criteria. On day 1 of each cycle, patients started
	with cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2), and dacarbazine
	600 mg/m(2); on day 2, patients received dacarbazine alone (600 mg/m(2)).
	Treatment cycles were repeated at 21-day intervals and 6 cycles were
	planned for each patient. The standard imaging procedure was computed
	tomography, and the primary end point was the objective tumor response
	rate. After chemotherapy, patients were followed up until progression.
	RESULTS: 9 patients underwent a total of 57 cycles (mean 6.3 +/-
	0.3 cycles). Treatment responses were: 0% complete response, 11%
	partial response, 56% stable disease, and 33% progressive disease.
	The median progression free survival was 13.6 months (range 5.8-24.2
	months). The median change (baseline vs. end of treatment) of calcitonin
	was -19% (range -70% to +174%). Reversible myelosuppression and moderate

	Although objective tumor response rates were low, the CVD regimen

  abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: Heme is an essential prosthetic group for most life
	on Earth. It functions in numerous cellular redox reactions, including
	in antioxidant defenses and at several stages of the electron transport
	chain in prokaryotes and eukaryotic mitochondria. Heme also functions
	as a sensor and transport molecule for gases such as oxygen. Heme
	is a complex organic molecule and can only be synthesized through
	a multienzyme pathway from simpler precursors. Most free-living organisms
	synthesize their own heme by a broadly conserved metabolic pathway.
	Parasites are adept at scavenging molecules from their hosts, and
	heme is no exception. RECENT ADVANCES: In this review we examine
	recent advances in understanding heme usage and acquisition in Apicomplexa,
	a group of parasites that include the causative agents of malaria,
	toxoplasmosis, and several major parasites of livestock. CRITICAL
	ISSUES: Heme is critical to the survival of Apicomplexa, although
	the functions of heme in these organisms remain poorly understood.
	Some Apicomplexa likely scavenge heme from their host organisms,
	while others retain the ability to synthesize heme. Surprisingly,
	some Apicomplexa may be able to both synthesize and scavenge heme.
	Several Apicomplexa live in intracellular environments that contain
	high levels of heme. Since heme is toxic at high concentrations,
	parasites must carefully regulate intracellular heme levels and develop
	mechanisms to detoxify excess heme. Indeed, drugs interfering with
	heme detoxification serve as major antimalarials. FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
	Understanding heme requirements and regulation in apicomplexan parasites
	promises to reveal multiple targets for much-needed therapeutic intervention
	against these parasites.},

	the prediction accuracy is 85.5% for inner membrane, 94.5% for matrix

  abstract = {Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the recommended treatment
	of uncomplicated P.falciparum malaria by the World Health Organisation
	(WHO). Some artemisinin compounds and anti-retroviral drugs have
	been shown to be metabolized by CYP2B6. In the African clinical settings,
	the likelihood of co-administration of ACTs and antiretroviral drugs
	is higher than elsewhere, posing the risk of drug-drug interactions
	(DDIs). This study aimed to investigate whether artemisinin compounds
	inhibit CYP2B6 activity in vitro using recombinant CYP2B6 (rCYP2B6)
	and human liver microsomes (HLM). Values for IC50 and Ki were determined
	by kinetic analyses using non-linear regression. In vitro to in vivo
	extrapolations of the likelihood of DDIs where done using a static
	[I]/Ki approach. Artemisinin and artemether were shown to inhibit
	CYP2B6 in vitro through a partial mixed type of inhibition, while
	dihydroartemisinin did not inhibit the enzymatic activity. IC50 values
	for artemisinin were 9.5 and 9.1 microM for rCYP2B6 and HLM, respectively,
	after 30 min of incubation. Corresponding values for artemether were
	7.5 and 5.4 microM. Artemisinin did not show any time-dependency
	or requirement of NADPH in its mechanism, indicating a reversible
	mode of inhibition. Based on the [I]/Ki approach using rCYP2B6, the
	risk of DDIs for artemisinin was indicated to be medium to high,
	while artemether had a low risk. The findings indicate a potential
	but moderate risk of DDIs in the co-administration of artemisinin
	or artemether with efavirenz in the co-treatment of malaria and HIV/AIDS.},

	domains of two genes, SREBF-2 1784G>C (rs2228314) and SCAP 2386A>G,
	are related to the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the
	risk of pre-hospital sudden cardiac death (SCD). METHODS: Whole genome
	expression profiling was completed in twenty vascular samples from
	carotid, aortic and femoral atherosclerotic plaques and six control
	samples from internal mammary arteries. Three hundred sudden pre-hospital
	deaths of middle-aged (33-69 years) Caucasian Finnish men were subjected
	to detailed autopsy in the Helsinki Sudden Death Study. Coronary
	narrowing and areas of coronary wall covered with fatty streaks or
	fibrotic, calcified or complicated lesions were measured and related
	to the SREBF-2 and SCAP genotypes. RESULTS: Whole genome expression
	profiling showed a significant (p = 0.02) down-regulation of SREBF-2
	in atherosclerotic carotid plaques (types IV-V), but not in the aorta
	or femoral arteries (p = NS for both), as compared with the histologically
	confirmed non-atherosclerotic tissues. In logistic regression analysis,
	a significant interaction between the SREBF-2 1784G>C and the SCAP
	2386A>G genotype was observed on the risk of SCD (p = 0.046). Men
	with the SREBF-2 C allele and the SCAP G allele had a significantly
	increased risk of SCD (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.07-6.71), compared to SCAP
	AA homologous subjects carrying the SREBF-2 C allele. Furthermore,
	similar trends for having complicated lesions and for the occurrence
	of thrombosis were found, although the results were not statistically
	significant. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the allelic variants
	(SREBF-2 1784G>C and SCAP 2386A>G) in the cholesterol homeostasis
	regulating SREBF-SCAP pathway may contribute to SCD in early middle-aged

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {12},
  pages = {471},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is regarded as a potential biomarker in
	the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The relations between aberrant
	gene methylation and cancer development have been identified by a
	number of recent scientific studies. In a previous work, we used
	co-occurrences to mine those associations and compiled the MeInfoText
	1.0 database. To reduce the amount of manual curation and improve
	the accuracy of relation extraction, we have now developed MeInfoText
	2.0, which uses a machine learning-based approach to extract gene
	methylation-cancer relations. DESCRIPTION: Two maximum entropy models
	are trained to predict if aberrant gene methylation is related to
	any type of cancer mentioned in the literature. After evaluation
	based on 10-fold cross-validation, the average precision/recall rates
	of the two models are 94.7/90.1 and 91.8/90% respectively. MeInfoText
	2.0 provides the gene methylation profiles of different types of
	human cancer. The extracted relations with maximum probability, evidence
	sentences, and specific gene information are also retrievable. The
	database is available at http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw:8081/MeInfoText2/.
	CONCLUSION: The previous version, MeInfoText, was developed by using
	association rules, whereas MeInfoText 2.0 is based on a new framework
	that combines machine learning, dictionary lookup and pattern matching
	for epigenetics information extraction. The results of experiments
	show that MeInfoText 2.0 outperforms existing tools in many respects.
	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a
	hybrid approach to extract gene methylation-cancer relations. It
	is also the first attempt to develop a gene methylation and cancer
	relation corpus.},

  pages = {jc20143490},
  abstract = {Context: Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), a protein secreted by the
	liver, is the main thyroid hormone (TH) transporter in human serum.
	TBG deficiency is characterized by reduced serum TH levels, but normal
	free TH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and absent clinical
	manifestations. The inherited form of TBG deficiency is usually due
	to a mutation in the TBG gene located on the X-chromosome. Objective:
	Of 75 families with X-chromosome linked TBG deficiency identified
	in our laboratory, no mutations in the TBG gene were found in 4 families.
	The aim of the study was to identify the mechanism of TBG deficiency
	in these four families using biochemical and genetic studies. Design:
	Observational cohort, prospective. Setting: University Research Center.
	Patients: Four families with inherited TBG deficiency and no mutations
	in the TBG gene. Intervention: Clinical evaluation, thyroid function
	tests and targeted re-sequencing of 1Mb of the X-chromosome. Results:
	Next generation sequencing identified a novel G to A variant 20kb
	downstream of the TBG gene in all 4 families. In silico analysis
	predicted that the variant resides within a liver-specific enhancer.
	In vitro studies confirmed the enhancer activity of a 2.2kb fragment
	of genomic DNA containing the novel variant and showed that the mutation
	reduces the activity of this enhancer. The affected subjects share
	a haplotype of 8Mb surrounding the mutation and the most recent common
	ancestor among the four families was estimated to be 19.5 generations
	ago [95% confidence intervals: 10.4-37]. Conclusions: To our knowledge,
	the present study is the first report of an inherited endocrine disorder

	To study the differences in gene expression between the Ig-unmutated

	corroborate a recent finding, according to which the expression of

	behaviours towards adults, juveniles and neonates, sensory cues that

	describe a juvenile pheromone produced by young mice before puberty,
	termed exocrine-gland secreting peptide 22 (ESP22). ESP22 is secreted
	from the lacrimal gland and released into tears of 2- to 3-week-old
	mice. Upon detection, ESP22 activates high-affinity sensory neurons
	in the vomeronasal organ, and downstream limbic neurons in the medial
	amygdala. Recombinant ESP22, painted on mice, exerts a powerful inhibitory
	effect on adult male mating behaviour, which is abolished in knockout
	mice lacking TRPC2, a key signalling component of the vomeronasal
	organ. Furthermore, knockout of TRPC2 or loss of ESP22 production
	results in increased sexual behaviour of adult males towards juveniles,
	and sexual responses towards ESP22-deficient juveniles are suppressed
	by ESP22 painting. Thus, we describe a pheromone of sexually immature
	mice that controls an innate social behaviour, a response pathway
	through the accessory olfactory system and a new role for vomeronasal
	organ signalling in inhibiting sexual behaviour towards young. These
	findings provide a molecular framework for understanding how a sensory

  abstract = {Apicomplexa are intracellular parasites that cause important human
	diseases including malaria and toxoplasmosis. During host cell infection
	new parasites are formed through a budding process that parcels out
	nuclei and organelles into multiple daughters. Budding is remarkably
	flexible in output and can produce two to thousands of progeny cells.
	How genomes and daughters are counted and coordinated is unknown.
	Apicomplexa evolved from single celled flagellated algae, but with
	the exception of the gametes, lack flagella. Here we demonstrate
	that a structure that in the algal ancestor served as the rootlet
	of the flagellar basal bodies is required for parasite cell division.
	Parasite striated fiber assemblins (SFA) polymerize into a dynamic
	fiber that emerges from the centrosomes immediately after their duplication.
	The fiber grows in a polarized fashion and daughter cells form at
	its distal tip. As the daughter cell is further elaborated it remains
	physically tethered at its apical end, the conoid and polar ring.
	Genetic experiments in Toxoplasma gondii demonstrate two essential
	components of the fiber, TgSFA2 and 3. In the absence of either of
	these proteins cytokinesis is blocked at its earliest point, the
	initiation of the daughter microtubule organizing center (MTOC).
	Mitosis remains unimpeded and mutant cells accumulate numerous nuclei
	but fail to form daughter cells. The SFA fiber provides a robust
	spatial and temporal organizer of parasite cell division, a process
	that appears hard-wired to the centrosome by multiple tethers. Our
	findings have broader evolutionary implications. We propose that
	Apicomplexa abandoned flagella for most stages yet retained the organizing
	principle of the flagellar MTOC. Instead of ensuring appropriate
	numbers of flagella, the system now positions the apical invasion
	complexes. This suggests that elements of the invasion apparatus
	may be derived from flagella or flagellum associated structures.},

  title = {FISH Amyloid - a new method for finding amyloidogenic segments in
	proteins based on site specific co-occurrence of aminoacids},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {15},
  pages = {54},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyloids are proteins capable of forming fibrils whose
	intramolecular contact sites assume densely packed zipper pattern.
	Their oligomers can underlie serious diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's and
	Parkinson's diseases. Recent studies show that short segments of
	aminoacids can be responsible for amyloidogenic properties of a protein.
	A few hundreds of such peptides have been experimentally found but
	experimental testing of all candidates is currently not feasible.
	Here we propose an original machine learning method for classification
	of aminoacid sequences, based on discovering a segment with a discriminative
	pattern of site-specific co-occurrences between sequence elements.
	The pattern is based on the positions of residues with correlated
	occurrence over a sliding window of a specified length. The algorithm
	first recognizes the most relevant training segment in each positive
	training instance. Then the classification is based on maximal distances
	between co-occurrence matrix of the relevant segments in positive
	training sequences and the matrix from negative training segments.
	The method was applied for studying sequences of aminoacids with
	regard to their amyloidogenic properties. RESULTS: Our method was
	first trained on available datasets of hexapeptides with the amyloidogenic
	classification, using 5 or 6-residue sliding windows. Depending on
	the choice of training and testing datasets, the area under ROC curve
	obtained the value up to 0.80 for experimental, and 0.95 for computationally
	generated (with 3D profile method) datasets. Importantly, the results
	on 5-residue segments were not significantly worse, although the
	classification required that algorithm first recognized the most
	relevant training segments. The dataset of long sequences, such as
	sup35 prion and a few other amyloid proteins, were applied to test
	the method and gave encouraging results. Our web tool FISH Amyloid
	was trained on all available experimental data 4-10 residues long,
	offers prediction of amyloidogenic segments in protein sequences.
	CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a new original classification method which
	recognizes co-occurrence patterns in sequences. The method reveals
	characteristic classification pattern of the data and finds the segments
	where its scoring is the strongest, also in long training sequences.
	Applied to the problem of amyloidogenic segments recognition, it
	showed a good potential for classification problems in bioinformatics.},

  abstract = {There are several clinically useful endoperoxides, mainly artemisinin
	derivatives available in market for the treatment of malaria. These
	are highly potent drugs, with fastest parasite reduction ratio, broadest
	parasite stage specificity and effectiveness against all species
	of plasmodium in human. Endoperoxides are crystalline compounds having
	poor aqueous solubility. Several theories have been proposed for
	their mechanism of action, but the understanding is still incomplete.
	The major limitation of this class of compounds is the short half-life,
	requiring frequent administration, leading to noncompliance and recrudescence.
	Therefore, WHO recommends their use in combination with long acting
	antimalarial drugs (Artemisinin based combination therapy, ACT) to
	manage drug resistance, recrudescence, and non compliance. Endoperoxide
	compounds bind selectively to malaria-infected red blood cells and
	moderately to human plasma proteins. Artemisinin derivatives are
	converted primarily to the bioactive metabolite dihydroartemisinin
	after parenteral, oral or rectal administration. The rate of conversion
	is lowest for artelinic acid and highest for the water-soluble artesunate.
	Such conversion occurs largely in the liver by CYP enzymes. Oral
	bioavailability in animals ranges between 19 to 35%. Based on their
	liphophilicity, they tend to cross the blood-brain barrier, causing
	neurotoxicity in animal models. Efforts have been made to understand
	and develop pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) correlation and
	identify PK-PD indices of endoperoxides. In the absence of the above,
	the selection of doses in ACTs has been empirical. There are several
	reports on clinical pharmacokinetic interactions of endoperoxides
	and their long acting partner drugs but as on date no clinically
	significant interaction has been reported. This review is an update

	in the UK in 2008, the majority of which were due to chloroquine-resistant
	Plasmodium falciparum. Poor adherence to prescribed regimens is known
	to be an important factor in these cases. METHOD: An observational
	study utilizing questionnaires both pre- and post-travel was conducted
	to assess the adherence behavior of UK travelers undertaking trips
	of less than 28 days duration, who were prescribed one of three antimalarials
	recommended to prevent P falciparum malaria (atovaquone plus proguanil,
	doxycycline, or mefloquine) in travel clinics in England and Scotland.
	The primary objectives of the study were to assess travelers' perceptions
	of, and self-reported adherence to antimalarial medication. A secondary
	objective was to examine the reasons for the choice of antimalarial
	therapy from the perspective of prescriber and traveler. RESULTS:
	For the primary end point of self-reported adherence specified as
	the proportion of antimalarial tablets prescribed that were actually
	taken, statistically significantly higher adherence overall and post-travel
	was seen with atovaquone plus proguanil compared with doxycycline.
	It was not possible to calculate the statistical significance of
	comparisons with mefloquine, but adherence to mefloquine appeared
	similar to or better than doxycycline and similar to atovaquone plus
	proguanil for categorical adherence. Effectiveness, side effects,
	previous experience of antimalarials, and dosing convenience were
	the main determinants of both travelers and practitioner's choice
	of antimalarial. The practitioner's recommendation was highly important
	for 63% of travelers. CONCLUSION: A shorter post-travel regimen has
	a significant impact on adherence to antimalarial prophylaxis. A
	reassessment of the risk by travelers on returning home may be a
	major contributor to this poor adherence.},

  volume = {6},
  pages = {179},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phylum Apicomplexa is an early-branching eukaryotic
	lineage that contains a number of important human and animal pathogens.
	Their complex life cycles and unique cytoskeletal features distinguish
	them from other model eukaryotes. Apicomplexans rely on actin-based
	motility for cell invasion, yet the regulation of this system remains
	largely unknown. Consequently, we focused our efforts on identifying
	actin-related proteins in the recently completed genomes of Toxoplasma
	gondii, Plasmodium spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Theileria spp.
	RESULTS: Comparative genomic and phylogenetic studies of apicomplexan
	genomes reveals that most contain only a single conventional actin
	and yet they each have 8-10 additional actin-related proteins. Among
	these are a highly conserved Arp1 protein (likely part of a conserved
	dynactin complex), and Arp4 and Arp6 homologues (subunits of the
	chromatin-remodeling machinery). In contrast, apicomplexans lack
	canonical Arp2 or Arp3 proteins, suggesting they lost the Arp2/3
	actin polymerization complex on their evolutionary path towards intracellular
	parasitism. Seven of these actin-like proteins (ALPs) are novel to
	apicomplexans. They show no phylogenetic associations to the known
	Arp groups and likely serve functions specific to this important
	group of intracellular parasites. CONCLUSION: The large diversity
	of actin-like proteins in apicomplexans suggests that the actin protein
	family has diverged to fulfill various roles in the unique biology
	of intracellular parasites. Conserved Arps likely participate in
	vesicular transport and gene expression, while apicomplexan-specific
	ALPs may control unique biological traits such as actin-based gliding

	extracellular/secretory, golgi, lysosomes, mitochondria, nucleus,
	plasma membrane and peroxisomes. Predictions are based on the location-specific
	protein functional domains and the amino acid compositional differences
	across different subcellular locations. Overall, this method can
	predict 68-87% of the true positives at accuracy rates of 96-99%.
	Comparison of the prediction performance against PSORT showed that
	pTARGET prediction rates are higher by 11-60% in 6 of the 8 locations

	and plays significant roles in regulating cellular processes. With
	the avalanche of genome sequences generated in the post-genomic age,
	it is highly desired to develop automated methods for rapidly and
	effectively identifying nucleosome positioning. Although some computational
	methods were proposed, most of them were species specific and neglected
	the intrinsic local structural properties that might play important
	roles in determining the nucleosome positioning on a DNA sequence.
	RESULTS: Here a predictor called 'iNuc-PseKNC' was developed for
	predicting nucleosome positioning in Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis
	elegans and Drosophila melanogaster genomes, respectively. In the
	new predictor, the samples of DNA sequences were formulated by a
	novel feature-vector called 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition',
	into which six DNA local structural properties were incorporated.
	It was observed by the rigorous cross-validation tests on the three
	stringent benchmark datasets that the overall success rates achieved
	by iNuc-PseKNC in predicting the nucleosome positioning of the aforementioned
	three genomes were 86.27%, 86.90% and 79.97%, respectively. Meanwhile,
	the results obtained by iNuc-PseKNC on various benchmark datasets
	used by the previous investigators for different genomes also indicated
	that the current predictor remarkably outperformed its counterparts.

	the parasite nuclear genome. A single PfIF1 is targeted to the apicoplast.
	Apart from its critical ribosomal interactions, PfIF1 also exhibited

	Of the three putative IF2 homologues, only one (PfIF2a) was an organellar

	another protein, PfIF3b, that was apicoplast targeted. PfIF3a exhibited
	ribosome anti-association activity, and monosome splitting by PfIF3a

	and disturbed its association with nuclear dots and cytoplasmic filaments.
	While the PHD zinc fingers were necessary for the transactivation

	database was constructed from pre-existing population-based anthropometric
	data obtained from household surveys and research groups. It contained
	data collected between 1995 and 2012 on 1,263,119 individuals (909,368

	generated using a generalized additive model for location, scale
	and shape by combining data with varying distributions from a range
	of sources. Countries were weighted by their population at risk of
	malaria to enable references to be used in optimizing the dosing
	of antimalarials. FINDINGS: Large differences in weight-for-age distributions
	existed between the regions and between the regions and global growth
	standards. For example, the average adult male from the Americas
	weighed 68.1 kg - 6.0 kg more than males in South-East Asia and the
	Western Pacific (average: 62.1 kg). For adult women, the difference
	was over 10.4 kg: the average was 60.4 kg in the Americas and 50.0
	kg in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. CONCLUSION: There
	were substantial variations in weight-for-age growth curves between
	malaria-endemic areas. The growth reference charts derived here can
	be used to guide the evidence-based optimization of aged-based dosing

  abstract = {The isolation of artemisinin from the traditional medicinal herb qing
	hao (Artemisia annua), its characterization as a peroxide and preparation
	of the derivatives dihydroartemisinin, artemether and artesunate
	in the 1970s and 1980s by Chinese scientists under the umbrella of
	Project 523 collectively represents one of the great events in medicine
	in the latter third of the 20(th) Century. Artemisinins have become
	the most important component of chemotherapy of malaria: although
	used initially in monotherapy, they are now used in combination therapies
	or ACTs with longer half-life quinolines or arylmethanols. Nevertheless,
	the recent emergence of artemisinin-tolerant strains of the malaria
	parasite as reflected in increased clearance times of parasitaemia
	in patients treated with ACTs represents the greatest threat to control
	of malaria since resistance to chloroquine was first reported over
	55 years ago. Importantly, the event brings into sharp focus the
	realization that relatively little is precisely understood, as opposed
	to widely assumed, for the mechanism of drug action of artemisinins
	and their synthetic peroxide analogues. Thus, we review here their
	antimalarial activities, the use of artemisinins in combination therapies,
	drug-drug interactions with the quinolines and arylmethanols, and
	metabolism of the artemisinins and synthetic peroxides. The mechanism
	of action of quinolines and arylmethanols, in particular their ability
	to induce redistribution of heme into the parasite cytosol, is also
	highlighted. This collective information is then used as a counterpoint
	to screen the validity of two of the prevailing hypotheses of drug
	action of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides, namely i. 'the C-radical
	hypothesis' wherein the peroxide undergoes 'bioactivation' by ferrous
	iron to generate C-radicals that are held to be the cytotoxic agents
	and ii. the 'heme hypothesis' wherein ferrous heme may generate either
	the same type of 'cytotoxic' C-radical, or the peroxide forms heme
	adducts that apparently inherit the exquisite cytotoxicities of the
	parent peroxide in one way or another. In a subsequent review, we
	screen the third and fourth hypotheses: the SERCA hypothesis wherein
	artemisinins modulate operation of the malaria parasite sarcoendo
	plasmic reticulum calcium pump SERCA Ca(2+)-ATPase ATP6 and the co-factor
	hypothesis wherein artemisinins act as oxidant drugs through rapidly
	oxidizing reduced conjugates of flavin cofactors, or those of flavin
	cofactor precursors such as riboflavin, and other susceptible endogenous
	substrates that play a role in maintaining intraparasitic redox homeostasis.
	For the C-radical hypothesis, details of in vitro chemical studies
	in the context of established chemistry of C-radicals and their ability
	to react with radical trapping agents such as nitroso compounds,
	cyclic nitrones, persistent nitroxyl radicals and atmospheric oxygen
	(dioxygen) are summarized. Overall, there is no correlation between
	antimalarial activities and abilities of the derived C-radicals to
	react with trapping agents in a chemical flask. This applies in particular
	to the reactions of C-radicals from artemisinins and steroidal tetraoxanes
	with the trapping agents vis-a-vis those from adamantyl capped systems.
	In an intraparasitic medium, it is not possible to intercept C-radicals
	either through use of a vast excess of a nitroxyl radical or dioxygen.
	The lack of correlation of antimalarial activities also applies to
	the Fe(2+)-mediated decomposition of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides,
	where literature data taken as indicating otherwise are critically
	assessed. The antagonism to antimalarial activities of artemisinins
	exerted by desferrioxamine (DFO) and related Fe(3+)-chelating agents
	is due to formation of stable chelates with bioavailable Fe(3+) that
	shuts down redox cycling through Fe(2+) and the subsequent generation
	of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the Fenton reaction. The generation
	of ROS by Fe(2+) complements the action of artemisinins, to be discussed
	in Part 2; there is no need to posit a reaction of Fe(2+) with the
	artemisinins to account for their antimalarial activity. The ability
	of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides to elicit membrane damage
	is examined in the light of established processes of autoxidation.
	The oxidant character of the intraparasitic environment is incompatible
	with the reducing conditions required for generation of C-radicals,
	and in contrast to the expectation raised by the C-radical hypothesis,
	and indeed by the heme hypothesis outlined below, antimalarial activities
	of artemisinins are enhanced under higher partial pressures of dioxygen.
	Structure-activity data from a wide variety of artemisinins and synthetic
	peroxides cannot be accommodated within the bounds of the C-radical
	hypothesis. Finally, the antimalarial Cradical construct sharply
	contrasts with that of the potently antitumour-active ene-diyne antibiotics
	such as neocarzinostatin. In an iron-free process, these compounds
	generate highly reactive aryl C-radicals that abstract H atoms from
	deoxyribose units in DNA to generate alkyl C-radicals. The last do
	react with dioxygen in a normal intracellular environment to initiate
	DNA strand cleavage. Overall, it must be concluded that the C-radical
	hypothesis as the basis for antimalarial activities of artemisinins
	and synthetic peroxides is untenable. Heme has been intensively studied
	as an 'activator' of artemisinins and other antimalarial peroxides,
	and indeed the hypothesis seemingly has become firmly embedded in
	the underlying brickwork of the scientific edifice. The locus of
	activity of the peroxides interacting with the heme is considered
	to be the parasite digestive vacuole. The basis for the nanomolar
	activities of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides is variously ascribed
	to heme-Fe(2+)-mediated generation of C-radicals from the peroxides,
	formation of heme-artemisinin adducts that are held either to engage
	in redox cycling with concomitant generation of ROS or to inhibit
	formation of hemozoin. In the last case, just like the aminoquinolines
	and arylmethanols, the peroxides are not the active agents, but exert
	their parasiticidal effects through allowing the build-up of free
	heme-Fe(3+), the ultimate cytotoxic entity. We assess the literature
	relating to generation of heme by hemoglobin digestion, and the stage
	at which this process becomes significant in the intraerythrocytic
	parasite. The claims of production of heme and conversion into hemozoin
	occurring in a lipid environment may have to be put aside based on
	recent literature data that indicates crystallization of hemozoin
	must take place an aqueous interface; association of lipids with
	the heme/hemozoin is likely to be a reflection of attractive van
	der Waals interactions involving the hydrophobic surface of the heme
	or hemozoin aggregates. In addition, the observation leading to the
	claim that hemozoin manufacture commences at the mid-ring stage cannot
	be independently verified. That the quinoline and arylmethanol antimalarials
	have essentially no activities on the ring stage parasites and exert
	greatest efficacy at the trophozoite stage where heme production
	is maximal is consistent with this. Conversely, artemisinins, and
	indeed redox active drugs such as methylene blue and others, are
	highly active against early ring stage parasites. Thus, there is
	a prominent disconnect between stage specificities of artemisinins
	vis-a-vis those of 4-aminoquinolines and arylmethanols suggesting
	that heme is not the target of the former class of drug. Further,
	the ability of the Fe(3+) chelate DFO to antagonize antimalarial
	activities of artemisinins, but not the activities of 4-aminoquinolines,
	cannot be explained by involvement of heme as a target for artemisinins.
	We critically examine the basis for formation of products obtained
	from reaction of heme with artemisinins and synthetic peroxides under
	conditions ranging from biomimetic - reactions employing catalytic
	reagents under aqueous or semi-aqueous conditions - to those conducted
	under highly reducing and eminently artificial conditions, usually
	in the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) that both forms well characterized
	complexes with heme-Fe(2+) and actually assists in driving single
	electron transfer processes. It is noted that alkylated products
	tend to form in high yields under the last conditions, and this aspect
	is readily explained. Irrespective of product yields obtained under
	various conditions, an overarching correlation between facility of
	the reaction of the peroxide with heme and their antimalarial activities
	does not exist. The is underscored by the reproducible outcomes of
	reactions conducted under biomimetic conditions indicating adducts
	cannot form in physiologically meaningful concentrations and that
	heme is a recalcitrant reaction partner to artemisinins in general.
	Again, as in the case of the C-radical hypothesis, structure-activity
	data from a wide variety of artemisinins and synthetic peroxides
	is difficult to reconcile with the heme hypothesis. This applies
	in particular to dimeric and trimeric artemisinin derivatives where
	the ascribing of biological activity to reactions of the derived
	radicals or to the vastly encumbered artemisinin-heme adducts is
	physically unrealistic. Finally, the facile metabolism and induction
	of metabolism of the current clinically used artemisinins by members
	of the CYP superfamily - heme proteins that require an intimate interaction
	of the heme with the artemisinin for metabolism to occur - is incompatible
	with the oft-cited proclivity of the peroxide to associate via complex
	formation with heme as a prelude to its 'activation' as an antimalarial
	agent within the malaria parasite. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

	a concatenated linear mt genome of the smallest size (6-kb); Babesia
	and Theileria have a linear monomeric mt genome (6.5-kb to 8.2-kb)
	with terminal inverted repeats; Eimeria, which is distantly related
	to Plasmodium and Babesia/Theileria, possesses a mt genome (6.2-kb)
	with a concatemeric form similar to that of Plasmodium; Cryptosporidium,
	the earliest branching lineage within the phylum Apicomplexa, has
	no mt genome. We are interested in the evolutionary origin of linear
	mt genomes of Babesia/Theileria, and have investigated mt genome
	structures in members of archaeopiroplasmid, a lineage branched off
	earlier from Babesia/Theileria. RESULTS: The complete mt genomes
	of archaeopiroplasmid parasites, Babesia microti and Babesia rodhaini,
	were sequenced. The mt genomes of B. microti (11.1-kb) and B. rodhaini
	(6.9-kb) possess two pairs of unique inverted repeats, IR-A and IR-B.
	Flip-flop inversions between two IR-As and between two IR-Bs appear
	to generate four distinct genome structures that are present at an
	equi-molar ratio. An individual parasite contained multiple mt genome
	structures, with 20 copies and 2 - 3 copies per haploid nuclear genome
	in B. microti and B. rodhaini, respectively. CONCLUSION: We found
	a novel linear monomeric mt genome structure of B. microti and B.
	rhodhaini equipped with dual flip-flop inversion system, by which
	four distinct genome structures are readily generated. To our knowledge,
	this study is the first to report the presence of two pairs of distinct

	Here we show that the P. falciparum genome does not encode caveolins

	plasma samples from patients reporting no antimalarial intake within
	the last 28 days were screened for the presence of 14 antimalarials
	(parent drugs or metabolites) using liquid chromatography-tandem

	at least one antimalarial in their plasma: 80 (54.1%) had lumefantrine
	above the lower limit of calibration (LLC = 4 ng/mL), 7 (4.7%) desbutyl-lumefantrine

	(2.5 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients with detectable
	antimalarial drug levels prior to enrollment into the study is worrying.
	Indeed artemether-lumefantrine was supposed to be available only
	at government health facilities. Although sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
	is only recommended for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy
	(IPTp), it was still widely used in public and private health facilities

	unreliable and thus screening for the presence of antimalarial drug
	levels should be considered in future in vivo studies to allow for
	accurate assessment of treatment outcome. Furthermore, persisting

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the utility of single-stranded conformation
	polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for mutation screening in the BTK (Bruton's
	tyrosine kinase) gene, we investigated 56 X-linked agammaglobulinemia
	(XLA) families. To obtain genotype/ phenotype correlations, predicted
	protein aberrations were correlated with the clinical course of the
	disease. PATIENTS: This study included 56 patients with XLA, with
	or without a positive family history, who were diagnosed on the basis
	of their clinical features, low peripheral B-cell count, and low
	immunoglobulin levels. Ten patients with isolated hypogammaglobulinemia
	and 50 healthy males served as controls. METHODS: SSCP analysis was
	performed for the entire BTK gene, including the exon-intron boundaries
	and the promoter region. Structural implications of the missense
	mutations were investigated by molecular modeling, and the functional
	consequences of some mutations also were evaluated by in vitro kinase
	assays and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: We report the largest
	series of patients with XLA to date. All but 5 of the 56 index patients
	with XLA screened with SSCP analysis showed BTK gene abnormalities,
	and in 2 of the 5 SSCP-negative patients, no BTK protein was found
	by Western blot analysis. There were 51 mutations, including 37 novel
	ones, distributed across the entire gene. This report contains the
	first promoter mutation as well as 14 novel missense mutations with
	the first ones described for the Tec homology domain and the glycine-rich
	motif in the SH1 domain. Each index patient had a different mutation,
	except for four mutations, each in two unrelated individuals. This
	result supports the strong tendency for private mutations in this
	disease. No mutations were found in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our
	results demonstrate that molecular genetic testing by SSCP analysis
	provides an accurate tool for the definitive diagnosis of XLA and
	the discrimination of borderline cases, such as certain hypogammaglobulinemia
	or common variable immunodeficiency patients with overlapping clinical
	features. Genotype/ phenotype correlations are not currently possible,
	making prediction of the clinical course based on molecular genetic
	data infeasible.},

	urine is presented. The method is based on the identification of
	a list of distinguishing features between proteins found in the urine
	of healthy people and proteins deemed not to be urine excretory.
	These features are used to train a classifier to distinguish the
	two classes of proteins. When used in conjunction with information
	of which proteins are differentially expressed in diseased tissues
	of a specific type versus control tissues, this method can be used
	to predict potential urine markers for the disease. Here we report
	the detailed algorithm of this method and an application to identification
	of urine markers for gastric cancer. The performance of the trained
	classifier on 163 proteins was experimentally validated using antibody
	arrays, achieving >80% true positive rate. By applying the classifier
	on differentially expressed genes in gastric cancer vs normal gastric
	tissues, it was found that endothelial lipase (EL) was substantially
	suppressed in the urine samples of 21 gastric cancer patients versus
	21 healthy individuals. Overall, we have demonstrated that our predictor

	serve as a powerful tool in searches for disease biomarkers in urine

	temperatures, we infer that the half-time at 25 degrees C for spontaneous
	hydrolytic dechlorination of trans-3-chloroacrylic acid is 10,000
	years, several orders of magnitude longer than half-times for spontaneous
	decomposition of other environmental pollutants such as 1,2-dichloroethane
	(72 years), paraoxon (13 months), atrazine (5 months), and aziridine
	(52 h). With thermodynamic parameters for activation similar to those
	for the spontaneous hydration of fumarate at pH 6.8, this slow reaction
	proceeds at a constant rate through the pH range between 2 and 12.
	However, at the active site of the enzyme 3-chloroacrylate dehalogenase
	(CaaD), isolated from a pseudomonad growing in these soils, hydrolytic
	dechlorination proceeds with a half-time of 0.18 s. Neither k(cat)
	nor k(cat)/K(m) is reduced by increasing solvent viscosity with trehalose,
	implying that the rate of enzymatic dechlorination is controlled
	by chemical events in catalysis rather than by diffusion-limited
	substrate binding or product release. CaaD achieves an approximately
	10(12)-fold rate enhancement, matching or surpassing the rate enhancements
	produced by many enzymes that act on more conventional biological
	substrates. One of those enzymes is 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase,

  abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma
	gondii, the causative agents of severe malaria and toxoplasmosis,
	respectively, undergo several critical developmental transitions
	during their lifecycle. Most important for human pathogenesis is
	the asexual cycle, in which parasites undergo rounds of host cell
	invasion, replication, and egress (exit), destroying host cell tissue
	in the process. Previous work has identified important roles for
	Protein Kinase G (PKG) and Protein Kinase A (PKA) in parasite egress
	and invasion, yet little is understood about the regulation of cyclic
	nucleotides, cGMP and cAMP, that activate these enzymes. To address
	this, we have focused upon the development of inhibitors of 3',5'-cyclic
	nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to block the breakdown of cyclic
	nucleotides. This was done by repurposing human PDE inhibitors noting
	various similarities of the human and apicomplexan PDE binding sites.
	The most potent inhibitors blocked the in vitro proliferation of
	P. falciparum and T. gondii more potently than the benchmark compound
	zaprinast. 5-Benzyl-3-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-one
	(BIPPO) was found to be a potent inhibitor of recombinant P. falciparum
	PfPDEalpha and activated PKG-dependent egress of T. gondii and P.
	falciparum, likely by promoting the exocytosis of micronemes, an
	activity that was reversed by a specific Protein Kinase G inhibitor.
	BIPPO also promotes cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of a P. falciparum
	ligand critical for host cell invasion, suggesting that the compound
	inhibits single or multiple PDE isoforms that regulate both cGMP
	and cAMP levels. BIPPO is therefore a useful tool for the dissection
	of signal transduction pathways in apicomplexan parasites.}

  abstract = {Dihydroorotase (DHOase, EC 3.5.2.3) from the extreme thermophile Bacillus
	caldolyticus has been subcloned, sequenced, expressed, and purified
	as a monomer. The catalytic properties of this thermophilic DHOase
	have been compared with another type I enzyme, the DHOase domain
	from hamster, to investigate how the thermophilic enzyme is adapted
	to higher temperatures. B. caldolyticus DHOase has higher Vmax and
	Ks values than hamster DHOase at the same temperature. The thermodynamic
	parameters for the binding of L-dihydroorotate were determined at
	25 degrees C for hamster DHOase (deltaG = -6.9 kcal/mol, deltaH =
	-11.5 kcal/mol, TdeltaS = -4.6 kcal/mol) and B. caldolyticus DHOase
	(deltaG = -5.6 kcal/mol, deltaH = -4.2 kcal/mol, TdeltaS = +1.4 kcal/mol).
	The smaller enthalpy release and positive entropy for thermophilic
	DHOase are indicative of a weakly interacting Michaelis complex.
	Hamster DHOase has an enthalpy of activation of 12.3 kcal/mol, similar
	to the release of enthalpy upon substrate binding, rendering the
	kcat/Ks value almost temperature independent. B. caldolyticus DHOase
	shows a decrease in the enthalpy of activation from 12.2 kcal/mol
	at temperatures from 30 to 50 degrees C to 5.3 kcal/mol for temperatures
	of 50-70 degrees C. Vibrational energy at higher temperatures may
	facilitate the transition ES --> ES(double dagger), making kcat/Ks
	almost temperature independent. The pseudo-first-order rate constant
	for water attack on L-dihydroorotate, based on experiments at elevated
	temperature, is 3.2 x 10(-11) s(-1) at 25 degrees C, with deltaH(double
	dagger) = 24.7 kcal/mol and TdeltaS(double dagger) = -6.9 kcal/mol.
	Thus, hamster DHOase enhances the rate of substrate hydrolysis by
	a factor of 1.6 x 10(14), achieving this rate enhancement almost
	entirely by lowering the enthalpy of activation (delta deltaH(double
	dagger) = -19.5 kcal/mol). Both the rate enhancement and transition
	state affinity of hamster DHOase increase steeply with decreasing
	temperature, consistent with the development of H-bonds and electrostatic
	interactions in the transition state that were not present in the
	enzyme-substrate complex in the ground state.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main determinant of continuous peripheral nerve block
	effects--local anesthetic concentration and volume or simply total
	drug dose--remains unknown. METHODS: We compared two different concentrations
	and basal rates of ropivacaine--but at equivalent total doses--for
	continuous posterior lumbar plexus blocks after hip arthroplasty.
	Preoperatively, a psoas compartment perineural catheter was inserted.
	Postoperatively, patients were randomly assigned to receive perineural
	ropivacaine of either 0.1% (basal 12 ml/h, bolus 4 ml) or 0.4% (basal
	3 ml/h, bolus 1 ml) for at least 48 h. Therefore, both groups received
	12 mg of ropivacaine each hour with a possible addition of 4 mg every
	30 min via a patient-controlled bolus dose. The primary endpoint
	was the difference in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)
	of the ipsilateral quadriceps the morning after surgery, compared
	with the preoperative MVIC, expressed as a percentage of the preoperative
	MVIC. Secondary endpoints included hip adductor and hip flexor MVIC,
	sensory levels in the femoral nerve distribution, hip range-of-motion,
	ambulatory ability, pain scores, and ropivacaine consumption. RESULTS:
	Quadriceps MVIC for patients receiving 0.1% ropivacaine (n = 26)
	declined by a mean (SE) of 64.1% (6.4) versus 68.0% (5.4) for patients
	receiving 0.4% ropivacaine (n = 24) between the preoperative period
	and the day after surgery (95% CI for group difference: -8.0-14.4%;
	P = 0.70). Similarly, the groups were found to be equivalent with
	respect to secondary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: For continuous posterior
	lumbar plexus blocks, local anesthetic concentration and volume do
	not influence nerve block characteristics, suggesting that local
	anesthetic dose (mass) is the primary determinant of perineural infusion
	effects.},

	illustrates the structural elements that are needed so that reductive

	1,2,4-trioxanes, 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, 1,2-dioxolanes, and 1,2-dioxanes
	is recounted, emphasizing aspects of design, mechanism, and the importance

	3-day food diary, serum albumin, Kt/V urea, and normalized protein
	catabolic rate (nPCR). A composite nutritional score was derived
	from SGA, body mass index, percent of reference weight, triceps skinfold,
	midarm muscle circumference, and serum albumin. RESULTS: In 72 HD
	patients an abnormal SGA identified a patient group with reduced
	midarm circumference, midarm muscle circumference and serum creatinine
	and an increased composite nutritional score. However, overlap of
	nutritional scores was considerable between the normal and abnormal
	SGA groups, suggesting that SGA misclassified a large number of subjects.
	Serum albumin correlated with C-reactive protein (r = -0.473, P <.0001),

	regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading

	information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide
	leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus

	a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of resistance to first line antimalarials
	led to recommendation of artemisinin based combination therapies
	(ACTs). High adherence to ACTs provided by community health workers
	(CHWs) gave reassurance that community based interventions did not
	increase the risk of drug resistance. Integrated community case management
	of illnesses (ICCM) is now recommended through which children will
	access both antibiotics and antimalarials from CHWs. Increased number
	of medicines has been shown to lower adherence. OBJECTIVE: To compare
	adherence to antimalarials alone versus antimalarials combined with
	antibiotics under ICCM in children less than five years. METHODS:
	A cohort study was nested within a cluster randomized trial that
	had CHWs treating children less than five years with antimalarials
	and antibiotics (intervention areas) and CHWs treating children with
	antimalarials only (control areas). Children were consecutively sampled
	from the CHWs' registers in the control areas (667 children); and
	intervention areas (323 taking antimalarials only and 266 taking
	antimalarials plus antibiotics). The sampled children were visited
	at home on day one and four of treatment seeking. Adherence was assessed
	using self reports and pill counts. RESULTS: Adherence in the intervention
	arm to antimalarials alone and antimalarials plus antibiotics arm
	was similar (mean 99% in both groups) but higher than adherence in
	the control arm (antimalarials only) (mean 96%). Forgetfulness (38%)
	was the most cited reason for non-adherence. At adjusted analysis:
	absence of fever (OR = 3.3, 95%CI =1.6-6.9), seeking care after two
	or more days (OR = 2.2, 95%CI = 1.3-3.7), not understanding instructions
	given (OR = 24.5, 95%CI = 2.7-224.5), vomiting (OR = 2.6, 95%CI =
	1.2-5.5), and caregivers' perception that the child's illness was
	not severe (OR = 2.0, 95%CI = 1.1-3.8) were associated with non-adherence.
	CONCLUSIONS: Addition of antibiotics to antimalarials did not lower
	adherence. However, caregivers should be adequately counseled to
	understand the dosing regimens; continue with medicines even when
	the child seems to improve; and re-administer doses that have been
	vomited.},

	Binding of the stable transition-state analog inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin

	9.9 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of the 6-hydroxyl group and

	contribute more than 10 kcal/mol to the free energy of binding of

	RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas the classical explanation was an impairment
	of phago/lysosomal function, antimalarials also appear to have an
	impact through inhibition of intracellular toll-like receptors (TLRs),
	particularly TLR9. This may mediate its effect on lupus, rheumatoid
	arthritis, as well as ancillary conditions including diabetes and
	hyperlipidemia. The potential role for antimalarials in antiphospholipid
	syndrome also appears clearer, with an effect proposed through Annexin5
	binding. SUMMARY: Despite their established clinical utility, the
	mode of action for antimalarials remains uncertain despite recent
	advances and still requires further investigation. By better understanding
	how antimalarials function, their optimal use in the clinical setting
	can be ensured.},

	peptides to contribute to tumor-specific CD4 T cell response. Because
	of the key role of CD4 T cell response in immunity to tumors, we
	investigated the CD4(+) T cell response to the recently identified
	tumor antigen Midkine (MDK). By weekly stimulations of T lymphocytes
	harvested from seven HLA-DR-typed healthy donors, we derived CD4(+)
	T cell lines specific for eight MDK peptides. Most of the T cell
	lines reacted with the peptides 9-23 and 14-28, located in and overlapping
	the MDK signal peptide, respectively. Accordingly, the MDK signal
	peptide appeared to be rich in good binders to common HLA-DR molecules.
	The peptide 9-23-specific T cell lines were specifically stimulated
	by autologous dendritic cells loaded with lysates of MDK-transfected

	protein. One T cell line was stimulated by HLA-compatible MDK-transfected

	were not stimulated in any of these conditions. Our data demonstrate
	that CD4(+) T cell epitopes present in the signal peptide can be
	accessible to recognition by CD4(+) T cells and may therefore contribute

	and a minor unknown sterol which appeared to be a C28:4 compound.
	We have also used RNA Seq analysis to identify seven genes found
	in the nonmevalonate/methylerythritol pathway (MEP) for sterol biosynthesis.
	Subsequent genome analysis of V. brassicaformis showed the presence
	of two mevalonate (MVA) pathway genes, though the genes were not
	observed in the transcriptome analysis. Transcripts from four genes
	(dxr, ispf, ispd, and idi) were selected and translated into proteins
	to study the phylogenetic relationship of sterol biosynthesis in
	V. brassicaformis and C. velia to other groups of algae and apicomplexans.
	On the basis of our genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we hypothesize

	ability, although contribution of the MVA pathway cannot be discounted.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most genetic disorders are linked to missense mutations
	as even minor changes in the size or properties of an amino acid
	can alter or prevent the function of the protein. Further, the effect
	of a mutation is also dependent on the sequence and structure context
	of the alteration. RESULTS: We investigated the spectrum of disease-causing
	missense mutations in secondary structure elements in proteins with
	numerous known mutations and for which an experimentally defined
	three-dimensional structure is available. We obtained a comprehensive
	map of the differences in mutation frequencies, location and contact
	energies, and the changes in residue volume and charge - both in
	the mutated (original) amino acids and in the mutant amino acids
	in the different secondary structure types. We collected information
	for 44 different proteins involved in a large number of diseases.
	The studied proteins contained a total of 2413 mutations of which
	1935 (80%) appeared in secondary structures. Differences in mutation
	patterns between secondary structures and whole proteins were generally
	not statistically significant whereas within the secondary structural
	elements numerous highly significant features were observed. CONCLUSION:
	Numerous trends in mutated and mutant amino acids are apparent. Among
	the original residues, arginine clearly has the highest relative
	mutability. The overall relative mutability among mutant residues
	is highest for cysteine and tryptophan. The mutability values are
	higher for mutated residues than for mutant residues. Arginine and
	glycine are among the most mutated residues in all secondary structures
	whereas the other amino acids have large variations in mutability
	between structure types. Statistical analysis was used to reveal
	trends in different secondary structural elements, residue types
	as well as for the charge and volume changes.},

  abstract = {EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway has an established role in promoting
	malignant growth and disease progression in human cancers. Therefore
	identification of transcriptional targets mediating the oncogenic
	effects of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway would be highly relevant. Cancerous
	inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is a recently characterized
	human oncoprotein. CIP2A promotes malignant cell growth and is over
	expressed at high frequency (40-80%) in most of the human cancer
	types. However, the mechanisms inducing its expression in cancer
	still remain largely unexplored. Here we present systematic analysis
	of contribution of potential gene regulatory mechanisms for high
	CIP2A expression in cancer. Our data shows that evolutionary conserved
	CpG islands at the proximal CIP2A promoter are not methylated both
	in normal and cancer cells. Furthermore, sequencing of the active
	CIP2A promoter region from altogether seven normal and malignant
	cell types did not reveal any sequence alterations that would increase
	CIP2A expression specifically in cancer cells. However, treatment
	of cancer cells with various signaling pathway inhibitors revealed
	that CIP2A mRNA expression was sensitive to inhibition of EGFR activity
	as well as inhibition or activation of MEK-ERK pathway. Moreover,
	MEK1/2-specific siRNAs decreased CIP2A protein expression. Series
	of CIP2A promoter-luciferase constructs were created to identify
	proximal -27 to -107 promoter region responsible for MEK-dependent
	stimulation of CIP2A expression. Additional mutagenesis and chromatin
	immunoprecipitation experiments revealed ETS1 as the transcription
	factor mediating stimulation of CIP2A expression through EGFR-MEK
	pathway. Thus, ETS1 is probably mediating high CIP2A expression in
	human cancers with increased EGFR-MEK1/2-ERK pathway activity. These
	results also suggest that in addition to its established role in
	invasion and angiogenesis, ETS1 may support malignant cellular growth
	via regulation of CIP2A expression and protein phosphatase 2A inhibition.},

	a coregulator capable of modulating transcriptional activity of various
	steroid receptors. We have characterized functional regions of ARIP3
	and studied its interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting
	protein 1 (GRIP1). We find that the potential zinc-binding domain
	is critical for ARIP3 to function as a coactivator; the deletion
	of amino acids 347-418 or the mutation of the conserved cysteines
	385 and 388 to serines converts ARIP3 to a transcriptional repressor
	from AR-dependent minimal promoters and abolishes its ability to
	activate GR. By contrast, mutations in the two LXXLL motifs of ARIP3
	have relatively minor effects on its ability to regulate AR or GR
	function. ARIP3 is able to interact with different regions of GRIP1,
	but the strongest interaction is detected with the C-terminal region
	(amino acids 1122-1462) of GRIP1. The interaction of ARIP3 with the
	latter GRIP1 domain or full-length GRIP1 and the ability of ARIP3
	to cooperate with GRIP1 in the regulation of AR- or GR-dependent
	transcription are dependent on the ARIP3 zinc-binding region. We
	also find a strong synergism between GRIP1 and two other PIAS family
	members, Miz1 and PIAS1. Taken together, our results suggest that

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyclophilins (Cyps) are peptidyl cis/trans isomerases
	implicated in diverse processes such as protein folding, signal transduction,
	and RNA processing. They are also candidate drug targets, in particular
	for the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A. In addition, cyclosporine
	is known to exhibit anti-parasitic effects on a wide range of organisms
	including several apicomplexa. In order to obtain new non-immunosuppressive
	drugs targeting apicomplexan cyclophilins, a profound knowledge of
	the cyclophilin repertoire of this phylum would be necessary. RESULTS:
	BLAST and maximum likelihood analyses identified 16 different cyclophilin
	subfamilies within the genomes of Cryptosporidium hominis, Toxoplasma
	gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Theileria annulata, Theileria parva,
	and Babesia bovis. In addition to good statistical support from the
	phylogenetic analysis, these subfamilies are also confirmed by comparison
	of cyclophilin domain architecture. Within an individual genome,
	the number of different Cyp genes that could be deduced varies between
	7-9 for Cryptosporidia and 14 for T. gondii. Many of the putative
	apicomplexan cyclophilins are predicted to be nuclear proteins, most
	of them presumably involved in RNA processing. CONCLUSION: The genomes
	of apicomplexa harbor a cyclophilin repertoire that is at least as
	complex as that of most fungi. The identification of Cyp subfamilies
	that are specific for lower eukaryotes, apicomplexa, or even the
	genus Plasmodium is of particular interest since these subfamilies
	are not present in host cells and might therefore represent attractive
	drug targets.}

	The ion-pairing process "masks" the protonated sample cations from
	the ESI-MS electric fields by rendering them "neutral. " Weakly basic
	molecules are not suppressed by this process. The TFA signal suppression
	effect is independent from the well-known spray problem that electrospray
	has with highly aqueous solutions that contain TFA. This previously
	reported spray problem is caused by the high conductivity and surface
	tension of aqueous TFA solutions. A practical method to enhance the
	signal for most basic analytes in the presence of signal-suppressing
	volatile strong acids has been developed. The method employs postcolumn
	addition of a solution of 75% propionic acid and 25% isopropanol
	in a ratio 1:2 to the column flow. Signal enhancement is typically
	10-50 times for peptides and other small basic molecules. Thus, peptide
	maps that use ESI-MS for detection can be performed at lower levels,
	with conventional columns, without the need to use capillary chromatography
	or reduced mass spectral resolution to achieve satisfactory sensitivity.
	The method may be used with similar results for heptafluorobutyric
	acid and hydrochloric acid. A mechanism for TFA signal suppression
	and signal enhancement by the foregoing method, is proposed.}

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {108},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lineage-specific genes, the genes that are restricted
	to a limited subset of related organisms, may be important in adaptation.
	In parasitic organisms, lineage-specific gene products are possible
	targets for vaccine development or therapeutics when these genes
	are absent from the host genome. RESULTS: In this study, we utilized
	comparative approaches based on a phylogenetic framework to characterize
	lineage-specific genes in the parasitic protozoan phylum Apicomplexa.
	Genes from species in two major apicomplexan genera, Plasmodium and
	Theileria, were categorized into six levels of lineage specificity
	based on a nine-species phylogeny. In both genera, lineage-specific
	genes tend to have a higher level of sequence divergence among sister
	species. In addition, species-specific genes possess a strong codon
	usage bias compared to other genes in the genome. We found that a
	large number of genus- or species-specific genes are putative surface
	antigens that may be involved in host-parasite interactions. Interestingly,
	the two parasite lineages exhibit several notable differences. In
	Plasmodium, the (G + C) content at the third codon position increases
	with lineage specificity while Theileria shows the opposite trend.
	Surface antigens in Plasmodium are species-specific and mainly located
	in sub-telomeric regions. In contrast, surface antigens in Theileria
	are conserved at the genus level and distributed across the entire
	lengths of chromosomes. CONCLUSION: Our results provide further support
	for the model that gene duplication followed by rapid divergence
	is a major mechanism for generating lineage-specific genes. The result
	that many lineage-specific genes are putative surface antigens supports
	the hypothesis that lineage-specific genes could be important in
	parasite adaptation. The contrasting properties between the lineage-specific
	genes in two major apicomplexan genera indicate that the mechanisms
	of generating lineage-specific genes and the subsequent evolutionary
	fates can differ between related parasite lineages. Future studies
	that focus on improving functional annotation of parasite genomes
	and collection of genetic variation data at within- and between-species
	levels will be important in facilitating our understanding of parasite
	adaptation and natural selection.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Two major high-penetrance breast cancer genes, BRCA1
	and BRCA2, are responsible for approximately 20% of hereditary breast
	cancer (HBC) cases in Finland. Additionally, rare mutations in several
	other genes that interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk
	of HBC. Still, a majority of HBC cases remain unexplained which is
	challenging for genetic counseling. We aimed to analyze additional
	mutations in HBC-associated genes and to define the sensitivity of
	our current BRCA1/2 mutation analysis protocol used in genetic counseling.
	METHODS: Eighty-two well-characterized, high-risk hereditary breast
	and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish
	individuals, were screened for germline alterations in seven breast
	cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, BRIP1, RAD50,
	and CDH1. BRCA1/2 were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe
	amplification (MLPA) and direct sequencing. CHEK2 was analyzed by
	the high resolution melt (HRM) method and PALB2, RAD50, BRIP1 and
	CDH1 were analyzed by direct sequencing. Carrier frequencies between
	82 (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals and
	384 healthy Finnish population controls were compared by using Fisher's
	exact test. In silico prediction for novel missense variants effects
	was carried out by using Pathogenic-Or-Not -Pipeline (PON-P). RESULTS:
	Three previously reported breast cancer-associated variants, BRCA1
	c.5095C > T, CHEK2 c.470T > C, and CHEK2 c.1100delC, were observed
	in eleven (13.4%) individuals. Ten of these individuals (12.2%) had
	CHEK2 variants, c.470T > C and/or c.1100delC. Fourteen novel sequence
	alterations and nine individuals with more than one non-synonymous
	variant were identified. One of the novel variants, BRCA2 c.72A >
	T (Leu24Phe) was predicted to be likely pathogenic in silico. No
	large genomic rearrangements were detected in BRCA1/2 by multiplex
	ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). CONCLUSIONS: In this
	study, mutations in previously known breast cancer susceptibility
	genes can explain 13.4% of the analyzed high-risk BRCA1/2-negative
	HBOC individuals. CHEK2 mutations, c.470T > C and c.1100delC, make
	a considerable contribution (12.2%) to these high-risk individuals
	but further segregation analysis is needed to evaluate the clinical
	significance of these mutations before applying them in clinical
	use. Additionally, we identified novel variants that warrant additional
	studies. Our current genetic testing protocol for 28 Finnish BRCA1/2-founder
	mutations and protein truncation test (PTT) of the largest exons

	We predict proteins or their domains like signal peptides using physical,

	This comprehensive set of properties may cover the diagnostic functional
	and structural aspects of a domain or a protein class. We automatically

	AMA1, a protein secreted from micronemes and associated with the

	More importantly, invasion inhibition assays using recombinant proteins
	demonstrate that the RON2-AMA1 interaction is crucial for both T.

	DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed cDNA microarray analysis using the
	Clontech hematology filter (containing 406 genes) on 15 patients
	to study gene expression profiling in AML. As reference, we used
	whole bone marrow from 5 healthy donors. RESULTS: Our results revealed
	50 differentially expressed genes in at least 3 out of 15 patients.
	Twenty-two genes were upregulated (ratio > or =4), whereas 28 genes
	were downregulated (ratio < or =0.25). All but one of the 13 genes
	tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed the same
	expression profiles. Among the overexpressed genes, several were
	those earlier associated with chromosomal translocations and gene
	fusions. These genes were FGFR1, MYC, NPM1, DEC, and BCL2. The expression
	of two upregulated genes, HOXA4 and CSF1R, was significantly higher

	x 10(9)/L cells, both CLC and GRN were significantly underexpressed,
	whereas HOXA4 and DAPK1 were overexpressed. FGFR1 and CAMLG were
	more frequently significantly overexpressed in patients with CD56

	significance of differential gene expression should be studied with
	a larger series of patients by using other techniques, such as quantitative

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic cells contain numerous compartments, which
	have different protein constituents. Proteins are typically directed
	to compartments by short peptide sequences that act as targeting
	signals. Translocation to the proper compartment allows a protein
	to form the necessary interactions with its partners and take part
	in biological networks such as signalling and metabolic pathways.
	If a protein is not transported to the correct intracellular compartment
	either the reaction performed or information carried by the protein
	does not reach the proper site, causing either inactivation of central
	reactions or misregulation of signalling cascades, or the mislocalized
	active protein has harmful effects by acting in the wrong place.
	RESULTS: Numerous methods have been developed to predict protein
	subcellular localization with quite high accuracy. We applied bioinformatics
	methods to investigate the effects of known disease-related mutations
	on protein targeting and localization by analyzing over 22,000 missense
	mutations in more than 1,500 proteins with two complementary prediction
	approaches. Several hundred putative localization affecting mutations
	were identified and investigated statistically. CONCLUSION: Although
	alterations to localization signals are rare, these effects should
	be taken into account when analyzing the consequences of disease-related

  pages = {491},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accomplishment of the various genome sequencing projects
	resulted in accumulation of massive amount of gene sequence information.
	This calls for a large-scale computational method for predicting
	protein localization from sequence. The protein localization can
	provide valuable information about its molecular function, as well
	as the biological pathway in which it participates. The prediction
	of localization of a protein at subnuclear level is a challenging
	task. In our previous work we proposed an SVM-based system using
	protein sequence information for this prediction task. In this work,
	we assess protein similarity with Gene Ontology (GO) and then improve
	the performance of the system by adding a module of nearest neighbor
	classifier using a similarity measure derived from the GO annotation
	terms for protein sequences. RESULTS: The performance of the new
	system proposed here was compared with our previous system using
	a set of proteins resided within 6 localizations collected from the
	Nuclear Protein Database (NPD). The overall MCC (accuracy) is elevated
	from 0.284 (50.0%) to 0.519 (66.5%) for single-localization proteins
	in leave-one-out cross-validation; and from 0.420 (65.2%) to 0.541
	(65.2%) for an independent set of multi-localization proteins. The
	new system is available at http://array.bioengr.uic.edu/subnuclear.htm.
	CONCLUSION: The prediction of protein subnuclear localizations can
	be largely influenced by various definitions of similarity for a
	pair of proteins based on different similarity measures of GO terms.
	Using the sum of similarity scores over the matched GO term pairs
	for two proteins as the similarity definition produced the best predictive
	outcome. Substantial improvement in predicting protein subnuclear
	localizations has been achieved by combining Gene Ontology with sequence

	antimalarials. In this study, to analyze the structure-activity relationships
	(SAR) of these quinolones and investigate the structural requirements
	for antimalarial activity, the 2D multiple linear regressions (MLR)
	method and 3D comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative
	molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) methods are employed
	to evolve different QSAR models. All these models give satisfactory
	results with highly accurate fitting and strong external predictive
	abilities for chemicals not used in model development. Furthermore,
	the contour maps from 3D models can provide an intuitive understanding
	of the key structure features responsible for the antimalarial activities.
	In conclusion, we summarize the detailed position-specific structural
	requirements of these derivatives accordingly. All these results
	are helpful for the rational design of new compounds with higher

	deaths. This situation was exacerbated by The Lord's Resistance Army

	health care system. While malaria remains the number one killer disease
	in northern Uganda, antimalarials are lacking in the public health
	facilities. Consequently, Private-for-profit drug-outlets have come
	up to help bridge the gap. However, the cost-effectiveness and treatment
	outcome ratings of antimalarials are not clear. Objective: To assess
	the pharmacoeconomics of malaria treatment in Private-for-profit
	(PFP) drug-outlets in Gulu Municipality and Kitgum Town Council.
	METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study sites were
	registered drug outlets. Study participants were drug-outlet owners,
	their employees, and malaria patients. We employed both purposive
	and random sampling methods to select the study participants. Data
	were collected using questionnaires and analysed using the SPSS computer
	package. RESULTS: Up to 91.1% of the respondents indicated that antimalarials
	are expensive. The prices varied from less than 5,000 to over 20,000
	Ugandan shillings per dose (Exchange rate: 1$ = Ush 2,650). Fansidar
	and chloroquine were rated as being relatively cheap and ACTs expensive
	(Ush 11,000 to 15,000). Duration of treatment, frequency of administration,
	needles and syringes, raised the cost of some medicines. Most patients
	preferred cheap medicines (76.2%); those with low administration
	frequencies (77.5%); and those with short treatment duration (95%).
	Most patients (80.9%) buy antimalarials without testing, while 66.6%
	do not buy full doses. CONCLUSION: The cost benefit analysis of the
	use of antimalarials is unfavourable. The unit price of the medicines,
	their irrational use and the lack of professionals in the outlets

	The mechanism of Abeta toxicity, however, remains largely unknown.
	In this work, we show that an early event after exposure of postmitotic

	FISH binds to and potentially regulates certain ADAM family members.
	We present evidence that FISH and ADAM12 mediate the neurotoxic effect

	blocks Abeta-induced neuronal death, and expression of an N-terminal
	fragment of FISH reduces Abeta toxicity. The C-terminal fragment
	of FISH containing the ADAMs binding region is found to be sufficient
	for induction of neuronal death, which is prevented by coexpression
	of the ADAM12DeltaMP. Abeta treatment, as well as expression of the
	C-terminal toxic FISH fragment, induces accumulation of ADAM12 N-terminal
	cleavage product in conditioned medium, demonstrating activation
	of the ADAM metalloprotease/sheddase activity. ADAM12 protein is

	that confer protease resistance, membrane activity and multivalence
	properties to proteins, all essential features for the undesired

	and causing type I allergy. METHODS: Amyloid propensity of beta-parvalbumin,
	the major fish allergen, was theoretically analysed and assayed under
	gastrointestinal-relevant conditions using the binding of thioflavin
	T, the formation of sodium dodecyl sulphate- (SDS-) resistant aggregates,
	circular dichroism spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy fibril
	imaging. Impact of amyloid aggregates on allergenicity was assessed
	with dot blot. RESULTS: Sequences of beta-parvalbumin from species
	with commercial value contain several adhesive hexapeptides capable
	of driving amyloid formation. Using Atlantic cod beta-parvalbumin
	(rGad m 1) displaying high IgE cross-reactivity, we found that formation
	of amyloid fibres under simulated gastrointestinal conditions accounts
	for the resistance to acid and neutral proteases, for the presence
	of membrane active species under gastrointestinal relevant conditions
	and for the IgE-recognition in the sera of allergic patients. Incorporation
	of the anti-amyloid compound epigallocatechin gallate prevents rGad
	m 1 fibrillation, facilitates its protease digestion and impairs
	its recognition by IgE. CONCLUSIONS: the formation of amyloid by
	rGad m 1 explains its degradation resistance, its facilitated passage
	across the intestinal epithelial barrier and its epitope architecture
	as allergen.}

	(HPC) have been suggested, including HPCX1 at Xq27-q28, but due to
	the complex structure of the region, the susceptibility gene has

	mRNA decay (NMD) inhibition was used for the discovery of truncating
	mutations. Six prostate cancer (PC) patients and their healthy brothers
	were selected from a group of HPCX1-linked families. Expression analyses
	were done using Agilent 44 K oligoarrays, and selected genes were
	screened for mutations by direct sequencing. In addition, microRNA
	expression levels in the lymphoblastic cells were analyzed to trace
	variants that might alter miRNA expression and explain partly an
	inherited genetic predisposion to PC. RESULTS: Seventeen genes were
	selected for resequencing based on the NMD array, but no truncating
	mutations were found. The most interesting variant was MAGEC1 p.Met1?.
	An association was seen between the variant and unselected PC (OR
	= 2.35, 95% CI = 1.10-5.02) and HPC (OR = 3.38, 95% CI = 1.10-10.40).
	miRNA analysis revealed altogether 29 miRNAs with altered expression
	between the PC cases and controls. miRNA target analysis revealed
	that 12 of them also had possible target sites in the MAGEC1 gene.
	These miRNAs were selected for validation process including four
	miRNAs located in the X chromosome. The expressions of 14 miRNAs
	were validated in families that contributed to the significant signal
	differences in Agilent arrays. CONCLUSIONS: Further functional studies
	are needed to fully understand the possible contribution of these
	miRNAs and MAGEC1 start codon variant to PC.},

	The first formal clinical trials of the artemisinins, and the development

	A decade later, Chinese scientists shared their findings with the
	rest of the world; since then, a significant body of international
	trial evidence has confirmed these drugs to be far superior to any
	available alternatives. In particular, they have the ability to rapidly
	kill a broad range of asexual parasite stages at safe concentrations
	that are consistently achievable via standard dosing regimens. As
	their half-life is very short, there was also thought to be a low
	risk of resistance. These discoveries coincided with the appearance
	and spread of resistance to all the other major classes of antimalarials.
	As a result, the artemisinins now form an essential element of recommended
	first-line antimalarial treatment regimens worldwide. To minimize
	the risk of artemisinin resistance, they are recommended to be used
	to treat uncomplicated malaria in combination with other antimalarials
	as artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). Their rollout has resulted
	in documented reductions in malaria prevalence in a number of African
	and Asian countries. Unfortunately, there are already worrisome early
	signs of artemisinin resistance appearing in western Cambodia. If
	this resistance were to spread, it would be disastrous for malaria

	including malaria and AIDS-associated opportunistic infections. Drug
	treatment for these diseases is not satisfactory and is threatened

	organelle, presents drug targets unique to these parasites. The apicoplast-localized
	fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) pathway, a metabolic process fundamentally
	divergent from the analogous FAS I pathway in humans, represents
	one such target. However, the specific biological roles of apicoplast
	FAS II remain elusive. Furthermore, the parasite genome encodes additional
	and potentially redundant pathways for the synthesis of fatty acids.
	We have constructed a conditional null mutant of acyl carrier protein,
	a central component of the FAS II pathway in Toxoplasma gondii. Loss
	of FAS II severely compromises parasite growth in culture. We show
	FAS II to be required for the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase,
	an important source of the metabolic precursor acetyl-CoA. Interestingly,
	acyl carrier protein knockout also leads to defects in apicoplast
	biogenesis and a consequent loss of the organelle. Most importantly,
	in vivo knockdown of apicoplast FAS II in a mouse model results in
	cure from a lethal challenge infection. In conclusion, our study
	demonstrates a direct link between apicoplast FAS II functions and
	parasite survival and pathogenesis. Our genetic model also offers

	free or protein-bound heme is responsible for intracellular activation
	of the endoperoxide group and that this is the chemical basis of
	cytotoxicity (IC(50) value and biomarker of bioactivation levels,

	ozonide antimalarial, OZ439, in a first-in-man, double-blind study
	in healthy volunteers. METHODS: OZ439 was administered as single
	oral daily doses of a capsule formulation (50-1200 mg) or an oral
	dispersion (400-1600 mg, fed and fasted states) and for up to 3 days
	as an oral dispersion (200-800 mg day(-1)). Plasma concentrations
	of OZ439 and its metabolites were measured by LC-MS. RESULTS: The
	pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of OZ439 was characterized by a t(max)
	of around 3 h, followed by a multiphasic profile with a terminal
	half-life of 25-30 h. The PK parameters were approximately dose proportional
	for each group and profiles of the metabolites followed a similar
	pattern to that of the parent compound. Following dosing for 3 days,
	accumulation was less than two-fold but steady-state was not achieved.
	In the presence of food, no effect was observed on the t(1/2) of
	OZ439 while the exposure was increased by 3 to 4.5-fold. Exposure
	was higher and inter-subject variability was reduced when OZ439 was
	administered as an oral dispersion compared with a capsule. The urinary
	clearance of OZ439 and its metabolites was found to be negligible
	and OZ439 did not induce CYP3A4. The antimalarial activity profiles
	of a subset of serum samples suggested that the major antimalarial
	activity originated from OZ439 rather than from any of the metabolites.
	CONCLUSION: The safety and pharmacokinetic profile of OZ439 merits
	progression to phase 2a proof of concept studies in the target population
	of acute uncomplicated malaria.},

  abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for normal development, growth and

	triiodothyronine (T3), acting as a ligand for the nuclear TH receptors
	(TRs) alpha and beta residing on thyroid hormone response elements
	(TREs) in the promoter of TH target genes. In this classical model
	of TH action, T3 binding to TRs leads to recruitment of basal transcription
	factors and increased transcription of TH responsive genes.Recently,
	the concept of TH action on gene expression has become more diverse
	and now includes nonclassical actions of T3 and T4: T3 has been shown
	to activate PI3K via the TRs, which ultimately increases transcription
	of certain genes, e.g. HIF-1alpha. Additionally, both T3 and thyroxine
	(T4) can bind to a membrane integrin, alphavbeta3, which leads to
	activation of the PI3K and MAPK signal transduction pathways and
	finally also increases gene transcription, e.g. of the FGF2 gene.
	Therefore, these initially nongenomic, nonclassical actions seem
	to serve as additional interfaces for transcriptional regulation
	by TH. Aim of this perspective is to summarize the genes that are
	currently known to be induced by nonclassical TH action and the mechanisms

	amino acid substitutions. OBJECTIVE: We report and study the complete
	deficiency TBG variant found in a patient from NeuIsenburg, Germany
	(TBG-CDNI). METHODS: Direct DNA sequencing was used to identify the
	TBG-CDNI mutation in the propositus, which was confirmed by allele-specific
	amplification. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Xenopus
	oocytes was used to study the secretion defect of TBG-CDNI and several
	variants by Western blot and T(4)-binding assay. RESULTS: The deletion
	of two nucleotides in codon 384 (1211_1212delTC) causes a frameshift
	altering the last 11 residues, introduces a new glycosylation site,
	and elongates the molecule by seven new amino acids. In contrast
	to normal TBG, TBG-CDNI was not secreted by Xenopus oocytes. Elongation
	of normal TBG by seven alanines did not affect its secretion or binding
	properties. On the other hand, neither disruption of its new glycosylation
	site nor termination of TBG-CDNI at the normal length repaired its
	secretion defect. CONCLUSIONS: In this first late termination variant
	of complete TBG deficiency, alteration of beta-strand 5B, located
	in the core of the molecule, rather than elongation of the molecule

	and hypothyroidism. Several lines of evidence suggest tumor-promoting
	effects of TH and TH receptors. They are possibly mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
	and MAPK and involve among others stimulation of angiogenesis via
	alphavbeta3. Thus, an increased risk for colon, lung, prostate, and
	breast cancer with lower TSH has been demonstrated in epidemiological
	studies, even suggesting a TH dose effect on cancer occurrence. Furthermore,
	higher TH levels were associated with an advanced clinical stage
	of breast and prostate cancer. In rodent models, TH stimulated growth
	and metastasis of tumor transplants, whereas hypothyroidism had opposite
	effects. In clinical studies of glioblastoma and head and neck cancer,
	hypothyroid patients showed longer survival than euthyroid patients.
	Also, patients with renal cell cancer that were treated with the
	tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib and developed hypothyroidism
	in due course showed significantly longer survival than patients
	that remained euthyroid. Development of hypothyroidism was an independent
	predictor for survival in two studies. Yet, it is still possible
	that hypothyroidism is only a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy
	and does not positively influence treatment outcome by itself. Future
	cancer treatment studies, especially with substances that can induce
	hypothyroidism, should therefore be designed in a way that allows
	for an analysis of thyroid function status and its contribution on

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Thyroid hormone (TH) mediated changes in gene expression
	were thought to be primarily initiated by the nuclear TH receptor
	(TR) binding to a thyroid hormone response element in the promoter
	of target genes. A recently described extranuclear mechanism of TH
	action consists of the association of TH-liganded TRbeta with phosphatidylinositol
	3-kinase (PI3K) in the cytosol and subsequent activation of the PI3K
	pathway. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect
	of TH, TRbeta and PI3K on stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) expression in human
	cells. DESIGN: We treated human skin fibroblasts with triiodothyronine
	(T3) in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, a
	dominant negative PI3K subunit, Deltap85alpha, and the protein synthesis
	inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). The role of the TRbeta was studied
	in cells from patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH).
	STC-1 mRNA expression was measured by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We
	found an induction of STC1 by T3 in normal cells, but less in cells
	from subjects with RTH (2.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.04, P < 0.01).
	The effect of T3 was completely abrogated by blocking PI3K with LY294002
	(3.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.5; P < 0.05) and greatly reduced after
	transfection of a dominant negative PI3K subunit, demonstrating dependency
	on the PI3K pathway. CONCLUSION: These results establish STC1 as
	a TH target gene in humans. Furthermore, we show that STC1 induction
	by TH depends on both TRbeta and PI3K activation.},

	the growth of cells in vitro, calf serum (CS) is usually added to
	the medium to provide necessary nutrients and growth factors. However,
	the content of endogenous TH in the CS may obfuscate changes with

	a thyroidectomized calf (TxCS) for gene expression studies. METHODS:
	We describe the method for preparing a thyroidectomized calf, harvesting
	the blood and preparing the serum. We utilized methimazole in conjunction
	with the thyroidectomy to prevent TH synthesis in the event of regrowth
	of the thyroid remnant. RESULTS: Total triiodothyronine (T(3)) and
	thyroxine concentrations in TxCS were low at <30 ng/dL and <1 microg/dL,
	respectively. We compared the effect of T(3) on basic transcription
	element-binding protein (BTEB)1 and stanniocalcin (STC)-1 mRNA expression
	in human fibroblasts from a normal individual and a subject with
	resistance to TH (RTH) cultured in stripped-CS to TxCS and demonstrated
	that with stripped-CS and TxCS differences in the BTEB1 and STC-1

	Both stripped-CS and TxCS are suitable to detect subtle differences

	RESULTS: Mean body mass increased (P < 0.01) in each group, but treatment
	had no effect on gain in overall body mass, fat mass, or lean mass
	using analysis of variance. In all treatment groups combined, lean
	mass increased in each region; fat mass increased only in the waist
	region. Treatment had an effect (P = 0.039) on hip lean mass and
	a marginal effect (P = 0.077) on thigh fat. Regression analyses revealed
	that SPI+ diminished the increase in thigh fat (P = 0.018) and heightened
	the increase in hip lean (P = 0.035) mass. Carbohydrate intake (P

	a plethora of other signaling proteins including protein kinase C
	(PKC), Sab/SH3BP5, and caveolin-1. For example, the prolyl isomerase
	Pin1 negatively regulates Btk by decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation

	proteins. Defining these systems in parasites has been complicated
	by their evolutionary distance from model organisms and practical
	concerns in working with small, and somewhat fastidious cells. Comparative
	genomic analyses of Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium spp. and Cryptosporidium
	spp. reveal several interesting adaptations for calcium-related processes
	in parasites. Apicomplexans contain several P-type Ca2+ ATPases including
	an ER-type reuptake mechanism (SERCA), which is the proposed target
	of artemisinin. All three organisms also contain several genes related

	while plasma membrane-type (PMCA) Ca2+ ATPases and voltage-dependent
	calcium channels are exclusively found in T. gondii. Pharmacological

	homeostasis and release calcium to act as a signal. Downstream responses
	are controlled by a family of EF-hand containing calcium binding

  year = {2010},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {258},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium is of major concern today.
	Effective vaccines or successful applications of RNAi-based strategies
	for the treatment of malaria are currently unavailable. An unexplored
	area in the field of malaria research is the development of DNA-targeting
	drugs that can specifically interact with parasitic DNA and introduce
	deleterious changes, leading to loss of vital genome function and
	parasite death. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Advances in the development
	of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) with engineered DNA recognition domains
	allow us to design and develop nuclease of high target sequence specificity
	with a mega recognition site that typically occurs only once in the
	genome. Moreover, cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) can cross the cell
	plasma membrane and deliver conjugated protein, nucleic acid, or
	any other cargo to the cytoplasm, nucleus, or mitochondria. This
	article proposes that a drug from the combination of the CPP and
	ZFN systems can effectively enter the intracellular parasite, introduce
	deleterious changes in its genome, and eliminate the parasite from
	the infected cells. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Availability of a DNA-binding
	motif for more than 45 triplets and its modular nature, with freedom
	to change number of fingers in a ZFN, makes development of customized
	ZFN against diverse target DNA sequence of any gene feasible. Since
	the Plasmodium genome is highly AT rich, there is considerable sequence
	site diversity even for the structurally and functionally conserved
	enzymes between Plasmodium and humans. CPP can be used to deliver
	ZFN to the intracellular nucleus of the parasite. Signal-peptide-based
	heterologous protein translocation to Plasmodium-infected RBCs (iRBCs)
	and different Plasmodium organelles have been achieved. With successful
	fusion of CPP with mitochondrial- and nuclear-targeting peptides,
	fusion of CPP with 1 more Plasmodium cell membrane translocation
	peptide seems achievable. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Targeting
	of the Plasmodium genome using ZFN has great potential for the development
	of anti-malarial drugs. It allows the development of a single drug
	against all malarial infections, including multidrug-resistant strains.
	Availability of multiple ZFN target sites in a single gene will provide
	alternative drug target sites to combat the development of resistance
	in the future.},

	protein, Usp45. In order to further increase protein secretion from

	and the peptide sequence (amino acid substitutions) on secretion.
	We screened signal peptides based on their resulting secretion levels
	of Staphylococcus aureus nuclease and further evaluated them for
	secretion of Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase. Silent mutations alone
	gave an increase of up to 16% in the secretion of alpha-amylase through
	a mechanism consistent with relaxed mRNA folding around the ribosome
	binding site and enhanced translation. Targeted amino acid mutagenesis
	in Usp45sp, combined with additional silent mutations from the best
	clone in the initial screen, yielded an increase of up to 51% in
	maximum secretion of alpha-amylase while maintaining secretion at
	lower induction levels. The best sequence from our screen preserves
	the tripartite structure of the native signal peptide but increases
	the positive charge of the n-region. Our study presents the first

	aimed at improving the control of malaria but faced a number of challenges
	in implementation related to marketing of the drugs. This research
	investigated the effect of the change of the national malaria policy
	on drug sales and strategic marketing responses of antimalarial pharmaceutical
	companies in Kenya. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional design
	was employed to describe the existing state of antimalarials market
	in Kenya after the change of the malaria healthcare policy. RESULTS
	& CONCLUSION: Policy change did result in an increase in the sales
	of Coartem(R). Novartis Pharma recorded a 97% growth in sales of
	Coartem(R) between 2003 and 2004. However, this increase was not
	experienced by all the companies. Further, SPs (which had been replaced
	as first-line therapy for malaria) registered good sales. In most
	cases, these sales were higher than the sales of Coartem(R). Generally,
	the sales contribution of SPs and generic antimalarial medicines
	exceeded that of Coartem(R) for most distributors. The most common
	change made to marketing strategies by distributors (62.5%) was to
	increase imports of antimalarials. A total of 40% of the manufacturers
	preferred to increase their budgetary allocation for marketing activities.
	In view of the fact that continued sale of SP drugs and limited availability
	of AL poses the risk of increasing the incidence of malaria in Kenya,
	it is therefore, recommended that pharmacy surveillance systems be
	strengthened to ensure drugs that have been rendered non-viable or
	that prescription-only medicines are not sold contrary to the national
	guidelines.},

	and followed up with 92% presenting with fever. Presumptive treatment
	was used in 56% of patients treated with AL. On average 2.4 (1 -
	7) drugs was prescribed per encounter, indicating co-prescription
	of AL with other drugs. Children under five had higher odds of AL
	and antibiotics co-prescription (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46 - 0.85)

	diagnosed SLE patients within the first year of follow-up. Approximately
	20% did not receive any medical treatment. Women were more likely
	than men to start AM (adjusted HR of 1.28 (95% CI 1.08-1.52)). Patients
	diagnosed with SLE between 2005 and 2011 were more likely to start
	treatment than patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2004 (HR of 1.21
	(95% CI 1.07-1.36)). Patients with renal disease were less likely
	to start AM treatment than patients without this condition (adjusted
	HR of 0.50 (95% CI 0.36-0.68)). Current users of corticosteroids
	were more likely to start AM treatment than non-users (adjusted HR
	1.81 (95% CI 1.59-2.06)). CONCLUSION: Time to start of AM treatment

  abstract = {During the last 10 years, an increasing number of genes have been
	identified whose abnormalities account for primary immunodeficiencies,
	with defects in development and/or function of the immune system.
	Among them is the JAK3-gene, encoding for a tyrosine kinase that
	is functionally coupled to cytokine receptors which share the common
	gamma chain. Defects of this gene cause an autosomal recessive form
	of severe combined immunodeficiency with almost absent T-cells and
	functionally defective B-cells (T(-)B(+) SCID). Herewith, we present
	molecular information on the first 27 unique mutations identified
	in the JAK3 gene, including clinical data on all of the 23 affected
	patients reported so far. A variety of mutations scattered throughout
	all seven functional domains of the protein, and with different functional
	effects, have been identified. Availability of a molecular screening
	test, based on amplification of genomic DNA, facilitates the diagnostic
	approach, and has permitted recognition that JAK3 deficiency may
	also be associated with atypical clinical and immunological features.
	Development of a structural model of the JAK3 kinase domain has allowed
	characterization of the functional effects of the various mutations.
	Most importantly, molecular analysis at the JAK3 locus results in
	improved genetic counseling, allows early prenatal diagnosis, and
	prompts appropriate treatment (currently based on hematopoietic stem
	cell transplantation) in affected families.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Malaria is a major public health problem in Sub-Saharan
	Africa where it kills a child under the age of five every 30 seconds.
	In Cameroon, malaria accounts for 40-45% of medical consultations,
	57% of hospitalization days and 40% of mortality among children below
	5 years. Community knowledge and practices can enhance the fight
	against this disease. The aim of the study was to make a local analysis
	of the people's knowledge and practices relating to the choice and
	source of antimalarials, self-medication, malaria dosage and resistance
	in order to establish behavioural baseline and epidemiological determinants
	and their implications for malaria control. METHODS: The design was
	a community-based cross-sectional study in a semi-urban setting.
	The survey consisted of 253 volunteer participants (from among 350
	contacted) from different socio-demographic backgrounds to whom structured
	questionnaires were administered. The respondent's consent was sought
	and gained and subjects who could not read or write or understand
	English language were communicated to in the local language. The
	questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers according
	to the schedule of the respondent. The data was analysed using SPSS.
	RESULTS: Antimalarials commonly cited for malaria treatment were
	chloroquine (26.1%) and nivaquine (14.6%) and analgesics: panadol
	(23%) and paracetamol (12.3%) including native drugs (6.3%). 141(55.7%)
	(95% confidence interval (CI): 49.6-61.8%) participants practiced
	self-medication of malaria. 26.1% participants knew the correct adult
	malarial dosage for chloroquine or nivaquine. 125(40.4%) (95% CI:
	34.4-46.7%) participants got their antimalarials from health centers,
	27(10.6%) from shops, 24(9.5%) from hawkers, 23(9.1%) from the open
	market and 16 (6.3%) from herbalists. 66 (26.1%) (95% CI: 20.7-31.5%)
	participants knew the correct adult dosage for chloroquine or nivaquine
	treatment of malaria. 85(33.6%) (95% CI: 27.8-36.6%) participants
	had correct knowledge of malarial resistance. Of the 85 (33.6%) participants
	who had correct knowledge of antimalarial drug resistance, 52(20.6%)
	ascribed antimalarial drug resistance to continuous fever for a long
	time during treatment, 15 (5.9%) to serious fever during treatment
	and 18 (7.1%) when chloroquine does not stop fever. 23(27.1%) participants
	with correct knowledge of malarial resistance were in the 31-35 age
	group bracket compared with other age groups (P=0.1). There was a
	significant difference in correct knowledge of malarial resistance
	and participant's profession (p=0.0). CONCLUSION: Malaria self-medication
	is common in Ndu but knowledge of antimalarial drug resistance is
	poor. Improvement in the self-treatment of malaria could be attained
	by providing clear information on choices of drugs for malaria treatment.
	Proper health information on the rational use of ant-malarial drugs
	must be provided in an appropriate manner to all groups of people
	in the society including village health workers, women associations,
	churches, school children, "Mngwah" opinion leaders, herbalists,
	health workers and chemists. Self-medication should be improved upon
	by giving correct information on the dosage of malaria treatment
	on radio, television, posters and newspapers because banning it will
	push many people to use it in hiding.},

	The structurally similar mitochondrial genomes of Chromera and Vitrella

	which may be further substituted with electrostatically favored positively

	favored but sterically disfavored group; iii) R4 position should
	be substituted with positively charged group lacking any carbon atom

	a DCX (doublecortin) and a partial p25-alpha domain. The DCX domains
	of the doublecortin superfamily are responsible for their microtubule
	binding and stabilizing properties. The p25-alpha domain occurs in
	TPPPs (Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Proteins) exhibiting Microtubule
	Associated Protein (MAP)-like functions. TPPP orthologs can be classified
	as long- and short-type ones. The latter ones do not contain the
	partial p25-alpha domain, which is the most conservative part of
	the long-type TPPPs and was evolutionary-preserved independently
	from the whole domain. Apicortin seems to occur only in the placozoan
	animal Trichoplax adhaerens and in each of the apicomplexan parasites,
	the genomes of which are available. The function of the novel protein
	can be predicted from the fact that it contains two different microtubule-binding
	domains. Apicomplexans, important pathogens of humans and animals,
	possess unique cytoskeletal elements, as subpellicular microtubules
	and apical polar rings, which are specific for this phylum, extremely
	stabilized by unknown MAPs. One of the candidates can be the apicortin,
	which is supported by a recent experimental proteomics analysis.
	The role of the new protein in T. adhaerens may be similar but needs

	RESULTS: An Internet resource called ImmTree http://bioinf.uta.fi/ImmTree
	was constructed for studying the evolution and evolutionary trees
	of the human immune system. ImmTree contains information about orthologs
	in 80 species collected from the HomoloGene, OrthoMCL and EGO databases.
	In addition to phylogenetic trees, the service provides data for
	the comparison of human-mouse ortholog pairs, including synonymous
	and non-synonymous mutation rates, Z values, and Ka/Ks quotients.
	A versatile search engine allows complex queries from the database.
	Currently, data is available for 847 human immune system related

	Retail prices were lowest for nATs, followed by ACTs and artemisinin
	monotherapies (AMTs). Retailers applied the highest percentage mark-ups
	on nATs (range: 40% in Nigeria to 100% in Cambodia and Zambia), whereas
	mark-ups on ACTs (range: 22% in Nigeria to 71% in Zambia) and AMTs
	(range: 22% in Nigeria to 50% in Uganda) were similar in magnitude,
	but lower than those applied to nATs. Wholesale mark-ups were generally
	lower than those at retail level, and were similar across antimalarial
	categories in most countries. When setting prices wholesalers and
	retailers commonly considered supplier prices, prevailing market
	prices, product availability, product characteristics and the costs
	related to transporting goods, staff salaries and maintaining a property.
	Price discounts were regularly used to encourage sales and were sometimes
	used by wholesalers to reward long-term customers. Pricing constraints
	existed only in Benin where wholesaler and retailer mark-ups are
	regulated; however, unlicensed drug vendors based in open-air markets
	did not adhere to the pricing regime. These findings indicate that
	mark-ups on antimalarials are reasonable. Therefore, improving ACT
	affordability would be most readily achieved by interventions that
	reduce commodity prices for retailers, such as ACT subsidies, pooled
	purchasing mechanisms and cost-effective strategies to increase the
	distribution coverage area of wholesalers.}

	study of 40 patients treated with antimalarials, who were referred
	to ophthalmology for the study of retinal toxicity during 2011. Data
	collection included type of antimalarial prescribed, daily and cumulative
	doses, presence of rheumatic disease, corticosteroid use, associated
	diseases and ophthalmologic examination. Retinal toxicity was confirmed
	if two of the following tests were altered: fundus examination, visual
	field with a macular pattern, changes in spectral domain optical
	coherence tomography and full-field electroretinography. RESULTS:
	Toxic retinopathy was detected in 13.1% of patients (95% confidence
	interval 5-21%) and a trend for a higher risk was observed in case
	of chloroquine (CQ) treatment. Among the patients with retinopathy,
	the mean cumulative dose was 229 g for CQ and 111 g for Hydroxychloroquine
	(HCQ), and the mean daily dose of CQ was 250 mg and 333 mg for HCQ.
	Arterial hypertension had a statistically significant effect on retinopathy
	development. CONCLUSIONS: Toxic retinopathy defined by ophthalmological
	evaluation was detected in 13.1% of patients. A trend for a higher
	risk was observed in case of chloroquine treatment.},

  abstract = {Signal peptides are a cornerstone mechanism for cellular protein localization,
	yet until now experimental determination of signal peptides has come
	from only a narrow taxonomic sampling. As a result, the dominant
	view is that Sec-cleaved signal peptides in prokaryotes are defined
	by a canonical AxA motif. Although other residues are permitted in
	the motif, alanine is by far the most common. Here we broadly examine
	proteomics data to reveal the signal peptide sequences for 32 bacterial
	and archaeal organisms from nine phyla and demonstrate that this
	alanine preference is not universal. Discoveries include fundamentally
	distinct signal peptide motifs from Alphaproteobacteria, Spirochaetes,
	Thermotogae and Euryarchaeota. In these novel motifs, alanine is
	no longer the dominant residue but has been replaced in a different
	way for each taxon. Surprisingly, divergent motifs correlate with
	a proteome-wide reduction in alanine. Computational analyses of ~1,500
	genomes reveal numerous major evolutionary clades which have replaced

  abstract = {Apicomplexans are a diverse group of obligate parasites occupying
	different intracellular niches that require modification to meet
	the needs of the parasite. To efficiently manipulate their environment,
	apicomplexans translocate numerous parasite proteins into the host
	cell. Whereas some parasites remain contained within a parasitophorous
	vacuole membrane (PVM) throughout their developmental cycle, others
	do not, a difference that affects the machinery needed for protein
	export. A signal-mediated pathway for protein export into the host
	cell has been characterized in Plasmodium parasites, which maintain
	the PVM. Here, we functionally demonstrate an analogous host-targeting
	pathway involving organellar staging prior to secretion in the related
	bovine parasite, Babesia bovis, a parasite that destroys the PVM
	shortly after invasion. Taking into account recent identification
	of a similar signal-mediated pathway in the coccidian parasite Toxoplasma
	gondii, we suggest a model in which this conserved pathway has evolved
	in multiple steps from signal-mediated trafficking to specific secretory
	organelles for controlled secretion to a complex protein translocation
	process across the PVM.}

	wherein similar amino acids are clustered together. Given the structural
	similarity exhibited by many apparently dissimilar sequences, we
	undertook this study looking for improvements in fold recognition
	by comparing protein sequences written in a reduced alphabet. RESULTS:
	We tested over 150 of the amino acid clustering schemes proposed
	in the literature with all-versus-all pairwise sequence alignments
	of sequences in the Distance mAtrix aLIgnment database. We combined
	several metrics from information retrieval popular in the literature:
	mean precision, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
	curve and recall at a fixed error rate and found that, in contrast
	to previous work, reduced alphabets in many cases outperform full
	alphabets. We find that reduced alphabets can perform at a level
	comparable to full alphabets in correct pairwise alignment of sequences
	and can show increased sensitivity to pairs of sequences with structural
	similarity but low-sequence identity. Based on these results, we
	hypothesize that reduced alphabets may also show performance gains
	with more sophisticated methods such as profile and pattern searches.

	88 (33.2%) developed persistent proteinuria, 44 (16.6%) cellular
	casts and 133 (50.2%) both; 233 patients (87.9%) were women; mean

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reversible modification of proteins through the attachment
	of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers is an essential post-translational
	regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes. The conjugation of ubiquitin
	or ubiquitin-like proteins has been demonstrated to play roles in
	growth, adaptation and homeostasis in all eukaryotes, with perturbation
	of ubiquitin-mediated systems associated with the pathogenesis of
	many human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe the use of an HMM
	search of functional Pfam domains found in the key components of
	the ubiquitin-mediated pathway necessary to activate and reversibly
	modify target proteins in eight apicomplexan parasitic protozoa for
	which complete or late-stage genome projects exist. In parallel,
	the same search was conducted on five model organisms, single-celled
	and metazoans, to generate data to validate both the search parameters
	employed and aid paralog classification in Apicomplexa. For each
	of the 13 species investigated, a set of proteins predicted to be
	involved in the ubiquitylation pathway has been identified and demonstrates
	increasing component members of the ubiquitylation pathway correlating
	with organism and genome complexity. Sequence homology and domain
	architecture analyses facilitated prediction of apicomplexan-specific
	protein function, particularly those involved in regulating cell
	division during these parasite's complex life cycles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	This study provides a comprehensive analysis of proteins predicted
	to be involved in the apicomplexan ubiquitin-mediated pathway. Given
	the importance of such pathway in a wide variety of cellular processes,
	our data is a key step in elucidating the biological networks that,
	in part, direct the pathogenicity of these parasites resulting in
	a massive impact on global health. Moreover, apicomplexan-specific
	adaptations of the ubiquitylation pathway may represent new therapeutic

  abstract = {Newly released human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles
	obligatorily undergo a maturation process to become infectious. The
	HIV-1 protease (PR) initiates this step, catalyzing the cleavage
	of the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol structural polyproteins. Proper organization
	of the mature virus core requires that cleavage of these polyprotein
	substrates proceeds in a highly regulated, specific series of events.
	The vital role the HIV-1 PR plays in the viral life cycle has made
	it an extremely attractive target for inhibition and has accordingly
	fostered the development of a number of highly potent substrate-analog
	inhibitors. Though the PR inhibitors (PIs) inhibit only the HIV-1
	PR, their effects manifest at multiple different stages in the life
	cycle due to the critical importance of the PR in preparing the virus
	for these subsequent events. Effectively, PIs masquerade as entry
	inhibitors, reverse transcription inhibitors, and potentially even
	inhibitors of post-reverse transcription steps. In this chapter,
	we review the triple threat of PIs: the intermolecular cooperativity
	in the form of a cooperative dose-response for inhibition in which
	the apparent potency increases with increasing inhibition; the pleiotropic
	effects of HIV-1 PR inhibition on entry, reverse transcription, and

	used to generate an extensive library of pentapeptide insertion mutants

	yielding mutants at 100% efficiency. Each mutant contained an accurate
	15-bp insertion that translated to five additional amino acids within
	the protein, and the insertions were distributed essentially randomly
	along the target sequence. Individual mutants (alpha-donors) were
	analyzed for their ability to restore (by alpha-complementation)
	beta-galactosidase activity of the M15 deletion mutant (alpha-acceptor),
	and the data were correlated to the structure of the beta-galactosidase
	tetramer. Most of the insertions were well tolerated, including many
	of those disrupting secondary structural elements even within the
	protein's interior. Nevertheless, certain sites were sensitive to
	mutations, indicating both known and previously unknown regions of
	functional importance. Inhibitory insertions within the N-terminus
	and loop regions most likely influenced protein tetramerization via
	direct local effects on protein-protein interactions. Within the
	domain 1 core, the insertions probably caused either lateral shifting
	of the polypeptide chain toward the protein's exterior or produced
	more pronounced structural distortions. Six percent of the mutant
	proteins exhibited temperature sensitivity, in general suggesting
	the method's usefulness for generation of conditional phenotypes.
	The method should be applicable to any cloned protein-encoding gene.},

	The use of HER2 specific CPP conjugated to mTOR specific ZFN, will

	to non-specific target DNA. The transpososome functions as a molecular
	DNA-modifying machine and has been used in a wide variety of molecular
	biology and genetics/genomics applications. To analyze structure-function
	relationships in MuA action, a comprehensive pentapeptide insertion
	mutagenesis was carried out for the protein. A total of 233 unique
	insertion variants were generated, and their activity was analyzed
	using a quantitative in vivo DNA transposition assay. The results
	were then correlated with the known MuA structures, and the data
	were evaluated with regard to the protein domain function and transpososome
	development. To complement the analysis with an evolutionary component,
	a protein sequence alignment was produced for 44 members of MuA family
	transposases. Altogether, the results pinpointed those regions, in
	which insertions can be tolerated, and those where insertions are
	harmful. Most insertions within the subdomains Igamma, IIalpha, IIbeta,
	and IIIalpha completely destroyed the transposase function, yet insertions
	into certain loop/linker regions of these subdomains increased the
	protein activity. Subdomains Ialpha and IIIbeta were largely insertion-tolerant.
	The comprehensive structure-function data set will be useful for
	designing MuA transposase variants with improved properties for biotechnology/genomics

  abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite which infects nearly
	one third of the human population and is found in an extraordinary
	range of vertebrate hosts. Its epidemiology depends heavily on horizontal
	transmission, especially between rodents and its definitive host,
	the cat. Neospora caninum is a recently discovered close relative
	of Toxoplasma, whose definitive host is the dog. Both species are
	tissue-dwelling Coccidia and members of the phylum Apicomplexa; they
	share many common features, but Neospora neither infects humans nor
	shares the same wide host range as Toxoplasma, rather it shows a
	striking preference for highly efficient vertical transmission in
	cattle. These species therefore provide a remarkable opportunity
	to investigate mechanisms of host restriction, transmission strategies,
	virulence and zoonotic potential. We sequenced the genome of N. caninum
	and transcriptomes of the invasive stage of both species, undertaking
	an extensive comparative genomics and transcriptomics analysis. We
	estimate that these organisms diverged from their common ancestor
	around 28 million years ago and find that both genomes and gene expression
	are remarkably conserved. However, in N. caninum we identified an
	unexpected expansion of surface antigen gene families and the divergence
	of secreted virulence factors, including rhoptry kinases. Specifically
	we show that the rhoptry kinase ROP18 is pseudogenised in N. caninum
	and that, as a possible consequence, Neospora is unable to phosphorylate
	host immunity-related GTPases, as Toxoplasma does. This defense strategy
	is thought to be key to virulence in Toxoplasma. We conclude that
	the ecological niches occupied by these species are influenced by
	a relatively small number of gene products which operate at the host-parasite
	interface and that the dominance of vertical transmission in N. caninum
	may be associated with the evolution of reduced virulence in this
	species.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bloom syndrome (BS) is characterized by mutations within
	the BLM gene. The Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) has similarity to
	the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicases, which contain seven conserved
	helicase domains and share significant sequence and structural similarity
	with the Rep and PcrA DNA helicases. We modeled the three-dimensional
	structure of the BLM helicase domain to analyze the structural basis
	of BS-causing mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sequence alignment
	was performed for RecQ DNA helicases and Rep and PcrA helicases.
	The crystal structure of PcrA helicase (PDB entry 3PJR) was used
	as the template for modeling the BLM helicase domain. The model was
	used to infer the function of BLM and to analyze the effect of the
	mutations. RESULTS: The structural model with good stereochemistry
	of the BLM helicase domain contains two subdomains, 1A and 2A. The
	electrostatic potential of the model is highly negative over most
	of the surface, except for the cleft between subdomains 1A and 2A
	which is similar to the template protein. The ATP-binding site is
	located inside the model between subdomains 1A and 2A; whereas, the
	DNA-binding region is situated at the surface cleft, with positive
	potential between 1A and 2A. CONCLUSIONS: The three-dimensional structure
	of the BLM helicase domain was modeled and applied to interpret BS-causing
	mutations. The mutation I841T is likely to weaken DNA binding, while
	the mutations C891R, C901Y, and Q672R presumably disturb the ATP
	binding. In addition, other critical positions are discussed.},

	A previous study of the incomplete genome of the human malarial parasite
	Plasmodium falciparum reports a higher than expected enrichment of
	poly dA.dT tracts, far above that anticipated even in this highly
	AT rich genome. Here we report an analysis of the relative frequency,
	length and spatial arrangement of homopolymer tracts for the complete
	P. falciparum genome, extending this analysis to twelve additional
	genomes of Apicomplexan parasites important to human and animal health.
	In addition, using nucleosome-positioning data available for P. falciparum,
	we explore the correlation of poly dA.dT tracts with nucleosome-positioning
	data over key expression landmarks within intergenic regions. RESULTS:
	We describe three apparent lineage-specific patterns of homopolymeric
	tract organization within the intergenic regions of these Apicomplexan
	parasites. Moreover, a striking pattern of enrichment of overly long
	poly dA.dT tracts in the intergenic regions of Plasmodium spp. uniquely
	extends into protein coding sequences. There is a conserved spatial
	arrangement of poly dA.dT immediately flanking open reading frames
	and over predicted core promoter sites. These key landmarks are all
	relatively depleted in nucleosomes in P. falciparum, as would be
	expected for poly dA.dT acting as nucleosome exclusion sequences.
	CONCLUSIONS: Previous comparative studies of homopolymer tract organization
	emphasize evolutionary diversity; this is the first report of such
	an analysis within a single phylum. Our data provide insights into

	protein tyrosine kinases with distinct functional domains PH, TH,
	SH3, SH2, and kinase. Mutations have been observed in each of the
	Btk subdomains in XLA. We have analyzed the Btk gene in six XLA patients
	from five unrelated families. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was prepared
	from the patients peripheral blood. The Btk exons including the junctional
	sequences were analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism
	(SSCP) followed by direct nucleotide sequencing after PCR-amplification.
	For structural analysis, the missense mutations were introduced into
	three-dimensional models of the PH and kinase domains of Btk and
	the outcome was predicted based on the knowledge of the protein function.
	RESULTS: Five novel mutations and two novel polymorphisms, all of
	which resulted from single-base alterations, were identified. Three
	of the five mutations were in the PH domain and two were in the kinase
	domain of Btk. Three of these mutations were of the missense type,
	two of which altered the same codon in the PH domain; the third one
	was located in the kinase domain. The fourth mutation was a point
	deletion in the PH domain causing a frameshift followed by premature
	termination. The fifth mutation was a splice donor-site mutation
	within the kinase domain which could result in an exon skipping.
	In four of the five instances, mothers of the patients were shown
	to be obligate carriers. In one instance, a sibling sister was identified
	as a heterozygote establishing her as a carrier. CONCLUSIONS: Functional
	consequences of the mutations causing frameshifts and altered splicing
	can be inferred directly. Functional consequences of the missense
	mutations were interpreted by 3-dimensional structural modeling of
	Btk domains. It is proposed that the two PH domain mutations will
	interfere with membrane localization while the kinase domain mutation
	will interfere with the enzymatic function of Btk. This study provides
	further insight into the role of Btk in XLA.},

	for the integration of the clinical, biochemical, genetic, genomic,
	proteomic, structural, and computational data of primary immunodeficiencies.
	The need for the IDR arises from the lack of structured and systematic
	information about primary immunodeficiencies on the Internet, and
	from the lack of a common platform which enables doctors, researchers,
	students, nurses and patients to find out validated information about
	these diseases. DESCRIPTION: The IDR knowledge base, first released
	in 1999, has grown substantially. It contains information for 158
	diseases, both from a clinical as well as molecular point of view.
	The database and the user interface have been reformatted. This new
	IDR release has a richer and more complete breadth, depth and scope.
	The service provides the most complete and up-to-date dataset. The
	IDR has been integrated with several internal and external databases
	and services. The contents of the IDR are validated and selected
	for different types of users (doctors, nurses, researchers and students,
	as well as patients and their families). The search engine has been
	improved and allows either a detailed or a broad search from a simple
	user interface. CONCLUSION: The IDR is the first knowledge base specifically
	designed to capture in a systematic and validated way both clinical
	and molecular information for primary immunodeficiencies. The service
	is freely available at http://bioinf.uta.fi/idr and is regularly
	updated. The IDR facilitates primary immunodeficiencies informatics
	and helps to parameterise in silico modelling of these diseases.
	The IDR is useful also as an advanced education tool for medical
	students, and physicians.}

	signs and symptoms - presenting a challenge for diagnosis. The information
	available from the Internet for over 200 PIDs is scattered between
	numerous services and databases. Patient information has been collected
	in different patient registries. Several software tools have been
	developed in order to build the databases, expert systems and other
	information systems useful in diagnosis or prediction. RECENT FINDINGS:
	Previously released services have been significantly improved and
	some new bioinformatics tools have been developed to help in diagnosis,
	prediction, mutation analysis and classification of PIDs. Several
	national initiatives have been launched for centralized PID information
	services. The very latest additions are tools and approaches for
	PID candidate gene prioritization, systematic classification and
	a medical expert system to help in diagnosis. SUMMARY: Many bioinformatics
	tools for PIDs are already freely available over the Internet. We
	expect bioinformatics tools to further help healthcare professionals
	in diagnosis, analysis and prediction. Currently, most of the resources
	are stand-alone and thus their integration will be a challenge for
	the future. Another challenge is to develop terminologies, ontologies

  abstract = {Cytidine deaminase (CDA) binds the inhibitor zebularine as its 3,4-hydrate
	(K(d) ~ 10(-12) M), capturing all but ~5.6 kcal/mol of the free energy
	of binding expected of an ideal transition state analogue (K(tx)
	~ 10(-16) M). On the basis of its entropic origin, that shortfall
	was tentatively ascribed to the trapping of a water molecule in the
	enzyme-inhibitor complex, as had been observed earlier for product
	uridine [Snider, M. J., and Wolfenden, R. (2001) Biochemistry 40,
	11364-11371]. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
	(FTICR-MS) of CDA nebularized in the presence of saturating 5-fluorozebularine
	reveals peaks corresponding to the masses of E(2)Zn(2)W(2) (dimeric
	Zn-CDA with two water molecules), E(2)Zn(2)W(2)Fz, and E(2)Zn(2)W(2)Fz(2),
	where Fz represents the 3,4-hydrate of 5-fluorozebularine. In the
	absence of an inhibitor, E(2)Zn(2) is the only dimeric species detected,
	with no additional water molecules. Experiments conducted in H(2)(18)O
	indicate that the added mass W represents a trapped water molecule
	rather than an isobaric ammonium ion. This appears to represent the
	first identification of an enzyme-bound water molecule at a subunit
	interface (active site) using FTICR-MS. The presence of a 5-fluoro
	group appears to retard the decomposition of the inhibitory complex
	kinetically in the vapor phase, as no additional dimeric complexes
	(other than E(2)Zn(2)) are observed when zebularine is used in place
	of 5-fluorozebularine. Substrate competition assays show that in
	solution zebularine is released from CDA (k(off) > 0.14 s(-1)) much
	more rapidly than is 5-fluorozebularine (k(off) = 0.014 s(-1)), despite
	the greater thermodynamic stability of the zebularine complex.},

	possible correlations between protein parameters and gene expression
	patterns to identify proteome-wide characteristics indicative of
	trends common to expressed proteins. RESULTS: Numerous bioinformatics
	methods were used to filter and merge information regarding gene
	and protein annotations. A new statistical time point-oriented analysis
	was developed for the study of dynamic correlations in large time
	series data. The method was applied to investigate microarray datasets
	for different cell types, organisms and processes, including human
	B and T cell stimulation, Drosophila melanogaster life span, and
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. CONCLUSION: We show that the
	properties of proteins synthesized correlate dynamically with the
	gene expression profile, indicating that not only is the actual identity
	and function of expressed proteins important for cellular responses
	but that several physicochemical and other protein properties correlate
	with gene expression as well. Gene expression correlates strongly
	with amino acid composition, composition- and sequence-derived variables,

  abstract = {Functioning as an "address tag" that directs nascent proteins to their
	proper cellular and extracellular locations, signal peptides have
	become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells

	the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly
	and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent
	protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in
	the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and
	critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting
	signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant,
	animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences,
	respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-3L that consists
	of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following
	three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein
	as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by
	fusing many individual OET-KNN (optimized evidence-theoretic K nearest
	neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of PseAA (pseudo
	amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set of candidates
	for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a query secretory
	protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm; (3) determining
	the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence alignment outcome
	for each of the aforementioned candidates through a voting system.
	Signal-3L is featured by high success prediction rates with short
	computational time, and hence is particularly useful for the analysis
	of large-scale datasets. Signal-3L is freely available as a web-server
	at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Signal-3L/ or http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Signal-3L,

	proteins are provided in a downloadable file. The large-scale file

	these basic classifiers was engineered by the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor)
	principle. As a demonstration, a new benchmark dataset was constructed
	that covers the following 18 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole,
	(3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7)
	endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) hydrogenosome,
	(11) lysosome, (12) mitochondria, (13) nucleus, (14) peroxisome,
	(15) plasma membrane, (16) plastid, (17) spindle pole body, and (18)
	vacuole. To avoid the homology bias, none of the proteins included
	has > or =25% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular
	location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the 5-fold
	and jackknife cross-validation tests were 81.6 and 80.3%, respectively,
	which were 40-50% higher than those performed by the other existing
	methods on the same strict dataset. The powerful predictor, named
	"Euk-PLoc", is available as a web-server at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/euk
	. Furthermore, to support the need of people working in the relevant
	areas, a downloadable file will be provided at the same website to
	list the results predicted by Euk-PLoc for all eukaryotic protein
	entries (excluding fragments) in Swiss-Prot database that do not
	have subcellular location annotations or are annotated as being uncertain.
	The large-scale results will be updated twice a year to include the
	new entries of eukaryotic proteins and reflect the continuous development
	of Euk-PLoc.},

  abstract = {Apicomplexan parasites are major pathogens of humans and domesticated
	animals. The ability of these organisms to evade the host immune
	response and the emergence of drug-resistant parasites indicates
	a need for the identification of novel control strategies. Ideally,
	selected targets should be shared by a range of apicomplexans and
	fundamental to parasite biology. One process of apicomplexan biology
	which may provide this type of target is the molecular regulation
	of stage differentiation. This paper has reviewed studies carried
	out on differentiation of Theileria annulata and has highlighted
	general similarities with other apicomplexan differentiation steps.
	Similarities include asynchrony of differentiation, the loss (attenuation)
	of differentiation potential and an association between reduced proliferation
	and differentiation. In addition, novel data are presented assessing
	a possible role for a signal transduction mechanism or a direct involvement
	of classical heat-shock polypeptides in regulating differentiation
	of T. annulata in vitro. These studies, and previously published
	data, have led to the postulation that progression to the next stage
	of the life-cycle can be predetermined and involves the attainment
	of a quantitative threshold by regulators of gene expression. A modification
	of this model takes into account that for certain in-vitro systems,
	or differentiation steps in vivo, the process has to be initiated
	by alteration of the extracellular environment. Work which has shown
	that the time taken to achieve differentiation can be increased or
	decreased is also outlined. The ability to change the timing of differentiation
	suggests that the associated regulatory mechanism could be manipulated
	directly to significantly influence the outcome of an apicomplexan
	infection. The observation that a number of existing drugs and control
	strategies may exert their protective effect by altering differentiation
	potential supports this possibility.},

	the mechanism by which spikes are selectively sorted into the viral
	bud or by which energy is provided for envelopment, remains unclear.
	RESULTS: Molecular models of the SFV capsid protein (SFCP) and the
	cytoplasmic domain of the spike protein were fitted as a basis for
	a reverse genetics approach to characterizing the interaction between
	these two proteins. Biochemical analysis of mutants defined a hydrophobic
	pocket of the capsid protein that is involved both in spike binding
	and nucleocapsid assembly. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that aromatic
	residues in the capsid protein serve to bind the side chain of the
	essential E2 tyrosine providing both specificity for spike incorporation
	and energy for budding. The same hydrophobic pocket also appears
	to play a role in capsid assembly. Furthermore, the results suggest
	that budding may occur in the absence of preformed nucleocapsids.
	This is the first demonstration of the molecular mechanisms of spike-nucleocapsid
	interactions during virus budding.},

	the thermodynamic changes that accompany substrate binding in the

	studies indicate that the action of cytidine deaminase is not diffusion-limited.
	Thus, K(m) appears to be a true dissociation constant, and k(cat)
	describes the chemical reaction of the ES complex, not product release.
	Enzyme-substrate association is accompanied by a loss of entropy
	and a somewhat greater release of enthalpy. As the ES complex proceeds
	to the transition state (ES), there is little further change in entropy,
	but heat is taken up that almost matches the heat that was released
	with ES formation. As a result, k(cat)/K(m) (describing the overall
	conversion of the free substrate to ES is almost invariant with changing
	temperature. The free energy barrier for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction
	(k(cat)/K(m)) is much lower than that for the spontaneous reaction
	(k(non)) (DeltaDeltaG = -21.8 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C). This difference,
	which also describes the virtual binding affinity of the enzyme for
	the activated substrate in the transition state (S), is almost entirely
	enthalpic in origin (DeltaDeltaH = -20.2 kcal/mol), compatible with
	the formation of hydrogen bonds that stabilize the ES complex. Thus,
	the transition state affinity of cytidine deaminase increases rapidly
	with decreasing temperature. When a hydrogen bond between Glu-91
	and the 3'-hydroxyl moiety of cytidine is disrupted by truncation
	of either group, k(cat)/K(m) and transition state affinity are each
	reduced by a factor of 10(4). This effect of mutation is entirely
	enthalpic in origin (DeltaDeltaH approximately 7.9 kcal/mol), somewhat
	offset by a favorable change in the entropy of transition state binding.
	This increase in entropy is attributed to a loss of constraints on
	the relative motions of the activated substrate within the ES complex.

	is 1.0109 (in H(2)O, pH 7.3), 1.0123 (in H(2)O, pH 4.2), and 1.0086
	(in D(2)O, pD 7.3). Increasing solvent D(2)O content has no substantial
	effect on k(cat) but enhances k(cat)/K(m), with a proton inventory
	showing that the fractionation factors of at least two protons increase
	markedly during the reaction. Mutant cytidine deaminases with reduced
	catalytic activity show more pronounced (15)N isotope effects of
	1.0124 (Glu91Ala), 1.0134 (His102Ala), and 1.0158 (His102Asn) at
	pH 7.3 in H(2)O, as expected for processes in which the chemical
	transformation of the substrate becomes more rate determining. The
	isotope effect of mutant His102Asn is 1.033 after correcting for
	protonation of the -NH(2) group, and represents the intrinsic isotope
	effect on C-N bond cleavage. This result allows an estimation of
	the forward commitment of the reaction with the wild-type enzyme.
	The observed (15)N kinetic isotope effect of the pyrimidine N-3,
	for wild-type cytidine deaminase acting on cytidine, is 0.9879, which
	is consistent with protonation and rehybidization of N-3 with hydroxide
	ion attack on the adjacent carbon to create a tetrahedral intermediate.
	These results show that enzymatic deamination of cytidine proceeds
	stepwise through a tetrahedral intermediate with ammonia elimination
	as the major rate-determining step. The primary (15)N isotope effects
	observed for the uncatalyzed reaction at pH 7 (1.0021) and pH 12.5
	(1.0034) were found to be insensitive to changing temperatures between
	100 and 185 degrees C. These results show that the uncatalyzed and
	the enzymatic deaminations of cytidine proceed by similar mechanisms,
	although the commitment to C-N bond breaking is greater for the spontaneous
	reaction.},

	present work, we determined the thermodynamic changes associated
	with the equilibrium binding of inhibitors by cytidine deaminase

	the binding of 3,4-dihydrozebularine (DeltaH = -10 kcal/mol), an
	analogue of 3,4-dihydrouridine in which a hydrogen atom replaces
	this inhibitor's 4-OH group, is consistent with the view that polar
	interactions with the substrate at the site of its chemical transformation
	play a critical role in reducing the enthalpy of activation for substrate
	hydrolysis. The entropic shortcomings of 3,4-dihydrouridine, in capturing
	all of the free energy involved in binding the actual transition

	Programmes for Antimalarials in Four African Countries: Results of

  journal = {Drug Saf},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {38},
  pages = {1115-26},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cohort event monitoring (CEM) is an intensive method
	of post-marketing surveillance for medicines safety. The method is
	based on prescription event monitoring, which began in the 1970s,
	and has since been adapted by WHO for monitoring the safety of medicines
	used in Public Health Programmes. CEM aims to capture all adverse
	events that occur in a defined group of patients after starting treatment
	with a specific medicine during the course of routine clinical practice.
	OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to describe the experiences
	of National Pharmacovigilance Centres (NCs) that have used CEM to
	monitor artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated
	malaria in the African setting, to raise awareness of some of the
	challenges encountered during implementation and to highlight aspects
	of the method that require further consideration. METHOD: A questionnaire-based
	survey was conducted to capture the experiences of NCs that have
	implemented CEM for active post-marketing surveillance of antimalarial
	medicines in sub-Saharan Africa. Six NCs were identified as having
	implemented CEM programmes and were invited to participate in the
	survey; five NCs indicated willingness to participate and were sent
	the questionnaire to complete. RESULTS: Four NCs responded to the
	survey-Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe-providing information on
	the implementation of a total of six CEM programmes. Their experiences
	indicate that CEM has helped to build pharmacovigilance capacity
	within the participating NCs and at the monitoring sites, and that
	healthcare providers (HCPs) are generally willing to participate
	in implementing the CEM method. All of the programmes took longer
	than expected to complete: contributing factors included a prolonged
	enrolment period and unexpectedly slow data entry. All of the programmes
	exceeded their budget by 11.1-63.2 %. Data management was identified
	as a challenge for all participating NCs. CONCLUSIONS: The reported
	experiences of four NCs that have undertaken CEM studies on ACTs
	indicate that CEM has helped to build pharmacovigilance capacity
	within NCs and monitoring sites and that HCPs are willing to participate
	in CEM programmes; however, the method was found to be labour intensive
	and data management was identified as a challenge. Reducing the workload
	associated with CEM, particularly in relation to data management,
	and integrating the method into the routine work of HCPs and NCs
	should be considered for future implementation.}

	computational process for drug discovery and design bridges this
	gap between theory and practice, and allows the application of quantum
	methods to large-scale in silico identification of active compounds.
	Here, we show the results of this quantum-similarity approach applied
	to the discovery of novel liver-stage antimalarials. Testing of only
	five of the model-predicted compounds in vitro and in vivo hepatic
	stage drug inhibition assays with P. berghei identified four novel
	chemical structures representing three separate quantum classes of
	liver-stage antimalarials. All four compounds inhibited liver-stage
	Plasmodium as a single oral dose in the quantitative PCR mouse liver-stage
	sporozoites-challenge model. One of the newly identified compounds,
	cethromycin [ABT-773], a macrolide-quinoline hybrid, is a drug with
	an extensive (over 5,000 people) safety profile warranting its exploitation
	as a new weapon for the current effort of malaria eradication. The
	results of our molecular modeling exceed current state-of-the-art
	computational methods. Drug discovery through quantum similarity
	is data-driven, agnostic to any particular target or disease process
	that can evaluate multiple phenotypic, target-specific, or co-crystal
	structural data. This allows the incorporation of additional pharmacological
	requirements, as well as rapid exploration of novel chemical spaces

	were performed in rats using these validated methods. The total systemic

	or piperaquine. However, co-administration of 99-411 significantly
	decreased the systemic exposure of piperaquine by half-fold while
	it had no effect on the kinetics of lumefantrine. 99-411, thus, seemed
	to be a good alternative to artemisinin derivatives for combination
	treatment with lumefantrine. To explore the reason for increased
	plasma levels of 99-411, an in situ permeability study was performed
	by co-perfusing lumefantrine and 99-411. In presence of lumefantrine,
	the absorption of 99-411 was significantly increased by 1.37 times
	than when given alone. Lumefantrine did not affect the metabolism
	of 99-411 when tested in vitro in human liver microsomes. Additionally,

	interaction (PPI) networks facilitate investigation and identification
	of proteins important for particular processes or diseases and reduces
	time and costs of experimental verification. Modeling the dynamics
	of very large PPI networks is computationally costly. RESULTS: To
	circumvent this problem, we created a link-weighted human immunome
	interactome and performed filtering. We reconstructed the immunome
	interactome and weighed the links using jackknife gene expression
	correlation of integrated, time course gene expression data. Statistical
	significance of the links was computed using the Global Statistical
	Significance (GloSS) filtering algorithm. P-values from GloSS were
	computed for the integrated, time course gene expression data. We
	filtered the immunome interactome to identify core components of
	the T cell PPI network (TPPIN). The interconnectedness of the major
	pathways for T cell survival and response, including the T cell receptor,
	MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways, are maintained in the TPPIN network.
	The obtained TPPIN network is supported both by Gene Ontology term
	enrichment analysis along with study of essential genes enrichment.
	CONCLUSIONS: By integrating gene expression data to the immunome
	interactome and using a weighted network filtering method, we identified
	the T cell PPI immune response network. This network reveals the
	most central and crucial network in T cells. The approach is general
	and applicable to any dataset that contains sufficient information.},

	intolerance of AMs, as well as disease related variables associated
	with non-use. METHODS: AM use was assessed in all our SLE patients
	included in a longitudinal cohort study. Demographic and disease
	characteristics were compared between users and non-users of AMs.
	Daily dosages of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) according to lean body
	weight were calculated. RESULTS: Out of 190 SLE patients in the cohort,
	139 (73.2%) were using AMs during their last visit, predominantly
	HCQ (136/139, 97.8%), while 92.1% (175/190) had ever used AMs. Daily
	dosage of HCQ was 400 mg in 115/136 (84.6%) patients. According to
	lean body weight, 119/136 (87.5%) had daily dosages of HCQ above
	the recommended 6.5 mg/kg. Patients did not use AMs (n=51) for the
	following reasons: intolerance (n=16), discontinued without a documented
	reason (n=11), never initiated (n=9), quiescent disease (n=7), contraindication
	(n=2), other (n=6). Only one patient discontinued HCQ due to AM-related
	retinopathy. Non-use of AMs was associated with a longer disease
	duration, higher damage accrual and a history of lupus nephritis.
	CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased awareness of the importance of AM
	treatment in SLE, there is still room for improvement, especially
	in patients with lupus nephritis and/or long-standing disease. Daily
	dosages of hydroxychloroquine often exceeded recommendations from
	guidelines, but are generally well-tolerated.},

	PATIENTSMETHODS: 325 lupus patients with abnormal creatine phosphokinase

	patients on statins/fibrates (n = 43) and/or active myositis (n =
	14) were excluded. The control group consisted of 1453 lupus patients

	RESULTS: Cases and controls did not differ regarding age at SLE diagnosis,
	gender ratio, or disease duration. AM use was more frequent in cases,
	which had more prolonged AM use. Total frequency of elevated CPK
	in AM users was 216/1322 (16.3%). Chloroquine was associated with
	a 3.3-fold, and hydroxychloroquine with a 3.1-fold, increased risk

	integration, storage and exchange. The data model was applied to
	primary immunodeficiencies, but it can be used for any hereditary

  number = {12},
  abstract = {X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a hereditary immunodeficiency
	caused by mutations in the gene encoding Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK).
	XLA patients have a decreased number of mature B cells and a lack
	of all immunoglobulin isotypes, resulting in susceptibility to severe
	bacterial infections. XLA-causing mutations are collected in a mutation
	database (BTKbase), which is available at http://bioinf.uta.fi/BTKbase.
	For each patient the following information is given (when available):
	the identification of the entry, a plain English description of the
	mutation followed by a reference, formal characterization of the
	mutation, and the various parameters from the patient. BTKbase is
	implemented with the MUTbase program suite, which provides an easy,
	interactive, and quality controlled submission of information to
	mutation databases. BTKbase version 8 lists mutation entries of 1,111
	patients from 973 unrelated families showing 602 unique molecular
	events. The localization of the mutations on the gene and protein
	for BTK can be analyzed by clicking sequences on the web pages. The
	distribution of the mutations in the five structural domains is approximately
	proportional to the length of the domains, except for the Tec homology
	(TH) domain. The most frequently affected sites are CpG dinucleotides.
	The majority of the missense mutations are structural-disturbing
	Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) folding or decreasing stability. Many
	of the mutations affect functionally significant, conserved residues.
	The structural consequences of the mutations in all the domains have
	been studied based on crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance
	(NMR) structures as well as computer-aided molecular modeling.},

  abstract = {The plastid (apicoplast) of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium
	falciparum was derived via a secondary endosymbiotic process. As
	in other secondary endosymbionts, numerous genes for apicoplast proteins
	are located in the nucleus, and the encoded proteins are targeted
	to the organelle courtesy of a bipartite N-terminal extension. The
	first part of this leader sequence is a signal peptide that targets
	proteins to the secretory pathway. The second, so-called transit
	peptide region is required to direct proteins from the secretory
	pathway across the multiple membranes surrounding the apicoplast.
	In this paper we perform a pulse-chase experiment and N-terminal
	sequencing to show that the transit peptide of an apicoplast-targeted
	protein is cleaved, presumably upon import of the protein into the
	apicoplast. We identify a gene whose product likely performs this
	cleavage reaction, namely a stromal-processing peptidase (SPP) homologue.
	In plants SPP cleaves the transit peptides of plastid-targeted proteins.
	The P. falciparum SPP homologue contains a bipartite N-terminal apicoplast-targeting
	leader. Interestingly, it shares this leader sequence with a Delta-aminolevulinic
	acid dehydratase homologue via an alternative splicing event.},

	and non-genetic variations is required to allow large scale studies,
	data mining and data integration, and to make it possible to reveal
	novel relationships between genotype and phenotype. Although lots
	of variation data is available it is often difficult to use due to
	lack of systematics. RESULTS: A novel ontology, Variation Ontology
	(VariO http://variationontology.org), was developed for annotation
	of effects, consequences and mechanisms of variations. In this article
	instructions are provided on how VariO annotations are made. The
	major levels for description are the three molecules, namely DNA,
	RNA and protein. They are further divided to four major sublevels:
	variation type, function, structure, and property, and further up
	to eight sublevels. VariO annotation summarizes existing knowledge
	about a variation and its effects and formalizes it so that computational
	analyses are efficient. The annotations should be made on as many
	levels as possible. VariO annotations are made in reference to normal
	states, which vary for each data item including e.g. reference sequences,
	wild type properties, and activities. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed instructions
	together with examples are provided to indicate how VariO can be
	used for annotation of variations and their effects. A dedicated
	tool has been developed for annotation and will be further developed
	to cover also evidence for the annotations. VariO is suitable for
	annotation of data in many types of databases. As several different
	kinds of databases are in a process of adapting VariO annotations
	it is important to have guidelines to guarantee consistent annotation.}

	in 14 immunodefects is presented. The proteins produced are employed
	in widely diverse functions, such as signal transduction, cell surface
	receptors, nucleotide metabolism, gene diversification, transcription
	factors, and phagocytosis. Altogether, the genetic defect of 2,140
	families has been determined. Diseases with X-chromosomal origin
	constitute about 70% of all the cases, presumably due to full penetrance
	and because the single affected allele causes the phenotype. All
	types of mutations have been identified; missense mutations are the
	most common mutation type, and truncation is the most common effect
	on the protein level. Mutational hotspots in many disorders appear
	in CPG dinucleotides. The mutation data for the majority of diseases
	are distributed on the Internet with a special database management
	system, MUTbase. Despite large numbers of mutations, it has not been
	possible to make genotype-phenotype correlations for many of the
	diseases.},

	markers amino-terminal type I collagen propeptide (PINP) and carboxyterminal

	Bone markers were analyzed at the initiation of the glucocorticoid

	children with IBD in remission (median PINP 271 vs 535 microg/l,

	serum IGF-I increased from 23 to 37 nmol/l (P<0.001). One month after
	the withdrawal of the glucocorticoid, all bone markers restored to

	reached: (1) null mutations on both alleles lead to the T-B-SCID

	NADP+. Besides this light-dependent reaction in nonphotosynthetic
	plastids (e.g. from roots), electrons can also flow in the reverse
	direction, from NADPH to ferredoxin, which then serves as an important
	reductant for various plastid-localized enzymes. These plastids possess
	related, but distinct, ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and ferredoxin
	isoforms for this purpose. We provide phylogenetic evidence that
	the T. gondii reductase is similar to such nonphotosynthetic isoforms.
	Both the P. falciparum [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin and the T. gondii ferredoxin-NADP+
	reductase possess an N-terminal bipartite transit peptide domain
	typical for apicoplast-localized proteins. The recombinant proteins
	were obtained in active form, and antibodies raised against the reductase
	recognized two bands on Western blots of T. gondii tachyzoite lysates,
	indicative of the unprocessed and native form, respectively. We propose
	that the role of this redox system is to provide reduced ferredoxin,
	which might then be used for fatty acid desaturation or other biosynthetic
	processes yet to be defined. Thus, the interaction of these two proteins
	offers an attractive target for drug intervention.},

	In this study, we used a total of 61,056 5'-end-single-pass cDNA
	sequences from Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. yoelii, P. berghei,
	Cryptosporidium parvum, and Toxoplasma gondii. We compared these

	In particular, we found that on average 14% of the exons in the current
	gene models were not supported by any cDNA evidence, and that 16%
	of the current gene models may contain at least one mis-annotation
	and should be re-evaluated. We also identified a large number of
	transcripts that had been previously unidentified. For 732 cDNAs

	140 previously unidentified transcripts found in the intergenic regions

	to those working on transmission-blocking immunity against Cryptosporidium
	and Plasmodium. Eimeria causes the disease known as coccidiosis in
	domestic animals. Coccidiosis is particularly problematic in the
	chicken industry, mainly due to the crowded rearing conditions under
	which chicks are raised. In our work we identified, isolated and
	characterized 3 major gametocyte antigens (230 kDa, 82 kDa and 56/54
	kDa) of Eimeria maxima. We used these native glycoproteins to immunize
	laying hens that, via the egg yolk, provide large amounts of transmission-blocking
	maternal antibodies to offspring chicks. We demonstrated that hatchlings
	from immunized hens shed 60-80% fewer oocysts (i.e. the infective
	stage of the life-cycle of Eimeria) than those from control hens.
	Such a reduction in oocyst output acts to significantly reduce parasite
	numbers in the litter of chicks raised in floor pens. This reduction
	in oocyst output is comparable to that seen using the most effective
	coccidiostat drugs and is probably sufficient to control coccidiosis
	under field conditions. Based on our results together with those
	of other groups working on transmission-blocking immunity against

	the essential problems in ecological studies. Next generation sequencing
	(NGS) technologies make it possible to obtain large amounts of metagenomic

	communities. De novo assembly of the short reads can be especially
	challenging because the number of genomes and their sequences are
	generally unknown and the coverage of each genome can be very low,
	where the traditional alignment-based sequence comparison methods
	cannot be used. Alignment-free approaches based on k-tuple frequencies,
	on the other hand, have yielded promising results for the comparison
	of metagenomic samples. However, it is not known if these approaches
	can be used for the comparison of metatranscriptome datasets and
	which dissimilarity measures perform the best. RESULTS: We applied
	several beta diversity measures based on k-tuple frequencies to real
	metatranscriptomic datasets from pyrosequencing 454 and Illumina
	sequencing platforms to evaluate their effectiveness for the clustering
	of metatranscriptomic samples, including three d2-type dissimilarity
	measures, one dissimilarity measure in CVTree, one relative entropy
	based measure S2 and three classical 1p-norm distances. Results showed
	that the measure d2(S) can achieve superior performance on clustering
	metatranscriptomic samples into different groups under different
	sequencing depths for both 454 and Illumina datasets, recovering
	environmental gradients affecting microbial samples, classifying
	coexisting metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, and being
	robust to sequencing errors. We also investigated the effects of
	tuple size and order of the background Markov model. A software pipeline
	to implement all the steps of analysis is built and is available
	at http://code.google.com/p/d2-tools/. CONCLUSIONS: The k-tuple based
	sequence signature measures can effectively reveal major groups and
	gradient variation among metatranscriptomic samples from NGS reads.
	The d2(S) dissimilarity measure performs well in all application

	It is thought to constitute the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase

	protein, the last step in the generation of amyloidogenic Abeta peptides.
	The latter are major constituents of amyloid plaques in the brain

	considered potential therapeutics for the treatment of this disease
	because they prevent production of Abeta peptides. Recently, we discovered
	a family of presenilin-type aspartic proteases. The founding member,
	signal peptide peptidase, catalyzes intramembrane cleavage of distinct
	signal peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of animals.
	In humans, the protease plays a crucial role in the immune system.
	Moreover, it is exploited by the hepatitis C virus for the processing
	of the structural components of the virion and hence is an attractive
	target for anti-infective intervention. Signal peptide peptidase
	and presenilin share identical active site motifs and both catalyze
	intramembrane proteolysis. These common features let us speculate
	that gamma-secretase inhibitors directed against presenilin may also
	inhibit signal peptide peptidase. Here we demonstrate that some of
	the most potent known gamma-secretase inhibitors efficiently inhibit
	signal peptide peptidase. However, we found compounds that showed

	neurona, are heterogamous parasites with sexual and asexual life
	stages in definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. During
	its sexual life stage, T. gondii reproduces either by genetic out-crossing
	or via clonal amplification of a single strain through self-mating.
	Out-crossing has been experimentally verified as a potent mechanism
	capable of producing offspring possessing a range of adaptive and
	virulence potentials. In contrast, selfing and other life history
	traits, such as asexual expansion of tissue-cysts by oral transmission
	among intermediate hosts, have been proposed to explain the genetic
	basis for the clonal population structure of T. gondii. In this study,
	we investigated the contributing roles self-mating and sexual recombination
	play in nature to maintain clonal population structures and produce
	or expand parasite clones capable of causing disease epidemics for
	two tissue encysting parasites. We applied high-resolution genotyping
	against strains isolated from a T. gondii waterborne outbreak that
	caused symptomatic disease in 155 immune-competent people in Brazil
	and a S. neurona outbreak that resulted in a mass mortality event
	in Southern sea otters. In both cases, a single, genetically distinct
	clone was found infecting outbreak-exposed individuals. Furthermore,
	the T. gondii outbreak clone was one of several apparently recombinant
	progeny recovered from the local environment. Since oocysts or sporocysts
	were the infectious form implicated in each outbreak, the expansion
	of the epidemic clone can be explained by self-mating. The results
	also show that out-crossing preceded selfing to produce the virulent
	T. gondii clone. For the tissue encysting coccidia, self-mating exists
	as a key adaptation potentiating the epidemic expansion and transmission
	of newly emerged parasite clones that can profoundly shape parasite
	population genetic structures or cause devastating disease outbreaks.},

	importance. We suggest that LMC theory should apply to eimeriorin

	showed a female-biased sex ratio, with the sex ratios suggesting
	high levels of selfing (0.8-1.0). Importantly, our estimate of the

	investigate the role of actin filaments in motility, we treated parasites

	the distribution of actin in live and fixed cells using yellow fluorescent

	have suggested that JAS induces rigor, videomicroscopy demonstrated
	that JAS treatment increased the rate of parasite gliding by approximately
	threefold, indicating that filaments are rate limiting for motility.
	However, JAS also frequently reversed the normal direction of motility,
	disrupting forward migration and cell entry. Consistent with this
	alteration, subcortical filaments in JAS-treated parasites occurred
	in tangled plaques as opposed to the straight, roughly parallel orientation

	2011), EMBASE (1980-May 2011), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts
	(1970-May 2011), Google and Google Scholar was conducted for articles
	describing the pharmacokinetics of antimalarials in pregnancy (and
	supplemented by a bibliographic review of all relevant articles);
	all identified studies were summarized and evaluated according to
	the level of evidence, based on the classification system developed
	by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Identified articles were
	included in the review if the study had at least one group that reported
	at least one pharmacokinetic parameter of interest in pregnant women.
	Articles were excluded from the review if no pharmacokinetic information
	was reported or if both pregnant and non-pregnant women were analysed
	within the same group. For quinine and its metabolites, there were
	three articles (one level II-1 and two level III); for artemisinin
	compounds, two articles (both level III); for lumefantrine, two articles
	(both level III); for atovaquone, two articles (both level III);

	two articles (one level II-1 and one level III); and for azithromycin,
	two articles (one level II-1 and one level III). Although comparative
	trials were identified, most of these studies were descriptive and
	classified as level III evidence. The main findings showed that pharmacokinetic
	parameters are commonly altered in pregnancy for the majority of
	recommended agents. Importantly, first-line regimens of artemisinin-based
	compounds, lumefantrine, chloroquine and pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine
	may undergo significant changes that could decrease therapeutic efficacy.
	These changes are usually due to increases in the apparent oral clearance
	and volume of distribution that commonly occur in pregnant women,
	and may result in decreased exposure and increased therapeutic failure.
	In order to assess the clinical implications of these changes and
	to provide safe and effective dosage regimens, there is an immediate
	need for dose-optimization studies of all recommended first- and
	second-line agents used in pregnant women with malaria.},

  abstract = {The distinct differences in gene control mechanisms acting in the
	nucleus between Plasmodium falciparum and the human host could lead
	to new potential drug targets for anti-malarial development. New
	molecular toolkits are required for dissecting molecular machineries
	in the P. falciparum nucleus. One valuable tool commonly used in
	model organisms is protein targeting to specific sub-cellular locations.
	Targeting proteins to specified locations allows labeling of organelles
	for microscopy, or testing of how the protein of interest modulates
	organelle function. In recent years, this approach has been developed
	for various malaria organelles, such as the mitochondrion and the
	apicoplast. A tool for targeting a protein of choice to the P. falciparum
	nucleus using an exogenous nuclear localization sequence is reported
	here.To develop a nuclear targeting system, a putative nuclear localization
	sequence was fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP). The nuclear
	localization sequence from the yeast transcription factor Gal4 was
	chosen because of its well-defined nuclear localization signal. A
	series of truncated Gal4 constructs was also created to narrow down
	the nuclear localization sequence necessary for P. falciparum nuclear
	import. Transfected parasites were analysed by fluorescent and laser-scanning
	confocal microscopy.The nuclear localization sequence of Gal4 is
	functional in P. falciparum. It effectively transported GFP into
	the nucleus, and the first 74 amino acid residues were sufficient
	for nuclear localization.The Gal4 fusion technique enables specific
	transport of a protein of choice into the P. falciparum nucleus,
	and thus provides a tool for labeling nuclei without using DNA-staining
	dyes. The finding also indicates similarities between the nuclear
	transport mechanisms of yeast and P. falciparum. Since the nuclear
	transport system has been thoroughly studied in yeast, this could
	give clues to research on the same mechanism in P. falciparum.},

	To estimate the rate enhancements produced by enzymes, and their

	cleavages of C-C, C-H, C-N, C-O, P-O, and S-O bonds in biological
	molecules, as well as the uncatalyzed reactions that correspond to
	phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by kinases and to peptidyl
	transfer in the ribosome. The rates of these reactions, some with
	half-lives in excess of one million years, span an overall range
	of 10(1)(9)-fold. Moreover, the slowest reactions tend to be most
	sensitive to temperature, with rates that increase as much as 10(7)-fold
	when the temperature is raised from 25 degrees to 100 degrees C.
	That tendency collapses, by many orders of magnitude, the time that

  abstract = {Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and
	are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical
	potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider
	must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use.
	It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective
	proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature
	peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly
	from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing,
	the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted
	bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies
	(support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree)
	and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for prediction of propeptide
	cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector
	machine (SVM) framework that combines both local and global sequence
	information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools
	for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation
	of the SVM method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences
	yielded 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced
	five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from
	the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test
	the accuracy of the predictor and found 80% sensitivity and 99.6%
	8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology
	information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins
	from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes,
	which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution
	of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool (SpiderP) is freely
	available on ArachnoServer (http://www.arachnoserver.org/spiderP.html),

	resistance to many of the current antimalarials make this disease

	used to discover new antimalarial agents, including target-based
	approaches, derivatization of known antimalarial pharmacophores,
	drug repositioning from non-malaria indication and cell-based screening.
	Specific examples are provided to illustrate the pros and cons in
	the context of how to best address the ever-increasing drug resistance
	and how to cost-effectively identify new antimalarials. More attention
	is given to relatively mature programs that have gone through extensive

	prepared either by cocrystallizing enzyme with uridine or by diffusing
	cytidine into ligand-free crystals show that the product binds as
	a 4-ketopyrimidine. They reveal four additional features of the catalytic
	process. (1) A water molecule bound to a site previously observed
	to bind the incoming 4-NH2 group represents the site for the leaving
	ammonia molecule. The conserved Pro 128 accommodates both moieties
	by orienting the carbonyl group of the previous residue. (2) The
	Glu 104 carboxylate group rotates from its hydrogen bond to the O4
	hydroxyl group in transition-state analog complexes, forming a new
	hydrogen bond to the leaving group moiety. Thus, after stabilizing
	the hydroxyl group in the transition state, Glu 104 transfers a proton
	from that group to the leaving amino group, promoting enol-to-keto
	isomerization of the product. (3) Difference Fourier comparisons
	with transition-state complexes indicate that the pyrimidine ring
	rotates toward the zinc by approximately 10 degrees. The active site
	thus "pulls" the ring and 4-NH2 group in opposite directions during
	catalysis. To preserve coplanarity of the 4-keto group with the pyrimidine
	ring, the N1-C1' glycosidic bond bends by approximately 19 degrees
	out of the ring plane. This distortion may "spring-load" the product
	complex and promote dissociation. Failure to recognize a similar
	distortion could explain an earlier crystallographic interpretation
	of the adenosine deaminase-inosine complex [Wilson, D. K., & Quiocho,
	F. A. (1994) Nat. Struct. Biol. 1, 691-694]. (4) The Zn-Sgamma132
	bond, which lengthens in transition-state complexes, shortens as
	the O4 atom returns to a state of lower negative charge in the planar
	product, consistent with our previous proposal that this bond buffers
	the zinc bond valence, compensating buildup of negative charge on
	the oxygen nucleophile during catalysis.},

	the activated water molecule than the position it occupies in either
	of two complexes with compounds capable of hydrogen bonding at the
	3-position of the ring [Xiang et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 4516-4523].
	Difference Fourier maps between the deazacytidine, dihydrozebularine,
	and zebularine--hydrate inhibitor complexes suggest that the ring
	itself moves successively toward the activated water, leaving the
	amino group behind in this site as the substrate complex approaches
	the transition state. They also reveal systematic changes in a single
	zinc-sulfur bond distance. These correlate with chemical changes
	expected as the substrate approaches the tetrahedral transition state,
	in which the zinc-activated hydroxyl group develops maximal negative
	charge and forms a short hydrogen bond to the neighboring carboxylate
	group of Glu 104. Empirical bond valence relationships suggest that
	the Zn-S gamma 132 bond functions throughout the reaction as a "valence
	buffer" that accommodates changing negative charge on the hydroxyl
	group. Similar structural features in alcohol dehydrogenase suggest
	that analogous mechanisms may be a general feature of catalysis by

	water molecule in the complex with the 3,4-dihydro analog, where
	contacts are substantially less favorable than those with the hydroxyl
	group of the transition-state analog. The hydrogen bond between the
	hydroxyl group and the Glu 104 carboxylate shortens in that complex,
	and may become a "low-barrier" hydrogen bond, since at the same time
	the bond between zinc and the Cys 132 thiolate ligand lengthens.
	These differences must therefore account for most of the differential
	binding affinity related to catalysis. Moreover, the trapped water
	molecule retains some of the binding energy stabilizing the hydroxyl
	group in the transition-state analog complex. To this extent, the
	ratio of binding affinities for the two compounds is smaller than

	approximately 50 muM) and did not show measurable time-dependent
	inhibition of either CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. DHA inhibited neither CYP2B6

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although hundreds of different signal peptides have now
	been identified, few studies have examined the factors enabling signal
	peptides to augment secretion of mature proteins. Signal peptides,
	located at the N-terminus of nascent secreted proteins, characteristically
	have three domains: (1) a basic domain at the N-terminus, (2) a central
	hydrophobic core, and (3) a carboxy-terminal cleavage region. In
	this study, we investigated whether alterations in the basic and/or
	the hydrophobic domains of a commonly used signal peptide from interleukin-2
	(IL-2) affected secretion of two proteins: placental alkaline phosphatase
	(AP) and endostatin. METHODS: A series of modifications in the basic
	and/or hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide were made by
	polymerase chain reaction with endostatin or AP plasmids as templates.
	Transfection of wild-type or modified IL-2 signal peptides fused
	in-frame with endostatin or AP were done with Superfect in vitro
	or by the hydrodynamic method in vivo. RESULTS: Increasing both the
	basicity and hydrophobicity of the signal peptide augmented the secretion
	of AP and endostatin by approximately 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively,
	from MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro. Over a range of DNA concentrations
	and times, the most effective IL-2 signal peptide increased AP levels
	in the medium compared to the wild-type IL-2 signal peptide. Comparable
	results from these modified IL-2 signal peptides were found to increase
	AP levels in the medium from bovine aortic endothelial cells. Moreover,
	the combined changes in basic and hydrophobic domains of the IL-2
	signal peptide augmented serum levels of endostatin and placental
	AP by 3-fold when the optimal plasmid constructs were injected in
	vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Modification of the IL-2 signal peptide augments
	protein secretion both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, optimizing
	the signal peptide should be considered for increasing the therapeutic
	levels of secreted proteins.},

  abstract = {Fast and effective prediction of signal peptides (SP) and their cleavage
	sites is of great importance in computational biology. The approaches
	developed to predict signal peptide can be roughly divided into machine
	learning based, and sliding windows based. In order to further increase
	the prediction accuracy and coverage of organism for SP cleavage
	sites, we propose a novel method for predicting SP cleavage sites
	called Signal-CTF that utilizes machine learning and sliding windows,
	and is designed for N-termial secretory proteins in a large variety
	of organisms including human, animal, plant, virus, bacteria, fungi
	and archaea. Signal-CTF consists of three distinct elements: (1)
	a subsite-coupled and regularization function with a scaled window
	of fixed width that selects a set of candidates of possible secretion-cleavable
	segment for a query secretory protein; (2) a sum fusion system that
	integrates the outcomes from aligning the cleavage site template
	sequence with each of the aforementioned candidates in a scaled window
	of fixed width to determine the best candidate cleavage sites for
	the query secretory protein; (3) a voting system that identifies
	the ultimate signal peptide cleavage site among all possible results
	derived from using scaled windows of different width. When compared
	with Signal-3L and SignalP 4.0 predictors, the prediction accuracy
	of Signal-CTF is 4–12 %, 10–25 % higher than that of Signal-3L
	for human, animal and eukaryote, and SignalP 4.0 for eukaryota, Gram-positive
	bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Comparing with
	PRED-SIGNAL and SignalP 4.0 predictors on the 32 archaea secretory
	proteins of used in Bagos’s paper, the prediction accuracy of Signal-CTF
	is 12.5 %, 25 % higher than that of PRED-SIGNAL and SignalP 4.0,
	respectively. The predicting results of several long signal peptides
	show that the Signal-CTF can better predict cleavage sites for long
	signal peptides than SignalP, Phobius, Philius, SPOCTOPUS, Signal-CF
	and Signal-3L. These results show that Signal-CTF is more accurate
	and flexible in predicting signal peptides of different characteristics
	for many organisms. Signal-CTF is freely available as a web-server

  abstract = {Human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (hHint1) is a member
	of a ubiquitous and ancient branch of the histidine triad protein
	superfamily. hHint1 is a homodimeric protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis
	of model substrates, phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate, with a high
	efficiency. Recently, catalytically inactive hHint1 has been identified
	as the cause of inherited peripheral neuropathy [Zimon, M., et al.
	(2012) Nat. Genet. 44, 1080-1083]. We have conducted the first detailed
	kinetic mechanistic studies of hHint1 and have found that the reaction
	mechanism is consistent with a double-displacement mechanism, in
	which the active site nucleophile His112 is first adenylylated by
	the substrate, followed by hydrolysis of the AMP-enzyme intermediate.
	A transient burst phase followed by a linear phase from the stopped-flow
	fluorescence assay indicated that enzyme adenylylation was faster
	than the subsequent intermediate hydrolysis and product release.
	Solvent viscosity experiments suggested that both chemical transformation
	and diffusion-sensitive events (product release or protein conformational
	change) limit the overall turnover. The catalytic trapping experiments
	and data simulation indicated that the true koff rate of the final
	product AMP is unlikely to control the overall kcat. Therefore, a
	protein conformational change associated with product release is
	likely rate-limiting. In addition, the rate of Hint1 adenylylation
	was found to be dependent on two residues with pKa values of 6.5
	and 8, with the former pKa agreeing well with the nuclear magnetic
	resonance titration results for the pKa of the active site nucleophile
	His112. In comparison to the uncatalyzed rates, hHint1 was shown
	to enhance acyl-AMP and AMP phosphoramidate hydrolysis by 10(6)-10(8)-fold.
	Taken together, our analysis indicates that hHint1 catalyzes the
	hydrolysis of phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate with high efficiency,
	through a mechanism that relies on rapid adenylylation of the active
	residue, His112, while being partially rate-limited by intermediate
	hydrolysis and product release associated with a conformational change.
	Given the high degree of sequence homology of Hint proteins across
	all kingdoms of life, it is likely that their kinetic and catalytic
	mechanisms will be similar to those elucidated for hHint1.},

	recently identified to code for a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (Bruton's
	agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase, BTK), required for normal B cell
	development. BTK, like many other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, contains
	Src homology domains (SH2 and SH3), and catalytic kinase domain.
	SH3 domains are important for the targeting of signaling molecules
	to specific subcellular locations. We have identified a family with
	XLA whose affected members have a point mutation (g-->a) at the 5'
	splice site of intron 8, resulting in the skipping of coding exon
	8 and loss of 21 amino acids forming the COOH-terminal portion of
	the BTK SH3 domain. The study of three generations within this kinship,
	using restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA analysis,
	allowed identification of the mutant X chromosome responsible for
	XLA and the carrier status in this family. BTK mRNA was present in
	normal amounts in Epstein-Barr virus-induced B lymphoblastoid cell
	lines established from affected family members. Although the SH3
	deletion did not alter BTK protein stability and kinase activity
	of the truncated BTK protein was normal, the affected patients nevertheless
	have a severe B cell defect characteristic for XLA. The mutant protein
	was modeled using the normal BTK SH3 domain. The deletion results
	in loss of two COOH-terminal beta strands containing several residues
	critical for the formation of the putative SH3 ligand-binding pocket.
	We predict that, as a result, one or more crucial SH3 binding proteins
	fail to interact with BTK, interrupting the cytoplasmic signal transduction
	process required for B cell differentiation.},

	(mainly artesunate and artemether) in the treatment of uncomplicated

	of the literature, based on Prescrire's standard methodology; (3)
	Trials of single-agent therapy with artemisinin derivatives showed
	rapid clinical and parasitological effects, but relapses were frequent
	during the weeks following treatment. Artemisinin derivatives are
	therefore used in combination with other antimalarials; (4) In 2006,

	alone. The artemether + lumefantrine combination has similar efficacy

	have different adverse effects, depending on the drugs used; (7)
	Artesunate is the artemisinin derivative most widely studied in pregnant

	no more frequent than in the general population; (8) In practice,
	in regions where P. falciparum malaria is endemic, early combination

During infection, fungal and oomycete pathogens secrete effector molecules which manipulate host plant cell processes to the pathogen's advantage. Proteinaceous effectors are synthesized intracellularly and must be externalized to interact with host cells. Computational prediction of secreted proteins from genomic sequences is an important technique to narrow down the candidate effector repertoire for subsequent experimental validation. In this study, we benchmark secretion prediction tools on experimentally validated fungal and oomycete effectors. We observe that for a set of fungal SwissProt protein sequences, SignalP 4 and the neural network predictors of SignalP 3 (D-score) and SignalP 2 perform best. For effector prediction in particular, the use of a sensitive method can be desirable to obtain the most complete candidate effector set. We show that the neural network predictors of SignalP 2 and 3, as well as TargetP were the most sensitive tools for fungal effector secretion prediction, whereas the hidden Markov model predictors of SignalP 2 and 3 were the most sensitive tools for oomycete effectors. Thus, previous versions of SignalP retain value for oomycete effector prediction, as the current version, SignalP 4, was unable to reliably predict the signal peptide of the oomycete Crinkler effectors in the test set. Our assessment of subcellular localization predictors shows that cytoplasmic effectors are often predicted as not extracellular. This limits the reliability of secretion predictions that depend on these tools. We present our assessment with a view to informing future pathogenomics studies and suggest revised pipelines for secretion prediction to obtain optimal effector predictions in fungi and oomycetes.},
