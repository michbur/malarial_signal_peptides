To date, raw sequence coverage is available for {\textgreater}90\% of the genome, and two chromosomes have been finished and annotated. Data in PlasmoDB are organized by chromosome (1-14), and can be accessed using a variety of tools for graphical and text-based browsing or downloaded in various file formats. The GUS (Genomics Unified Schema) implementation of PlasmoDB provides a multi-species genomic relational database, incorporating data from human and mouse, as well as P.falciparum. The relational schema uses a highly structured format to accommodate diverse data sets related to genomic sequence and gene expression. Tools have been designed to facilitate complex biological queries, including many that are specific to PLASMODIUM: parasites and malaria as a disease. Additional projects seek to integrate genomic information with the rich data sets now becoming available for RNA transcription, protein expression, metabolic pathways, genetic and physical mapping, antigenic and population diversity, and phylogenetic relationships with other apicomplexan parasites. The overall goal of PlasmoDB is to facilitate Internet- and CD-ROM-based access to both finished and unfinished sequence information by the global malaria research community.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with regard to its clinical course. The limitations of the methods currently available for prognostic assessment in CLL do not allow accurate prediction of the risk of disease progression in individual patients. The recently developed cDNA array technique provides a unique opportunity to study gene expression in various malignancies. To identify new molecular markers for prognostication of CLL patients, we analyzed cDNA arrays by using hierarchical clustering and standard statistic t-test on 34 CLL patients. We found significant expression differences in 78 genes compared to the reference tonsillar B lymphocytes. A cluster of genes, LCP1, PARP, BLR1, DEK, NPM, MCL1, SLP76, STAM, HIVEP1, EVI2B, CD25, HTLF, HIVEP2, BCL2, MNDA, PBX3, EB12, TCF1, CGRP, CD14, ILB, GZMK, GPR17 and CD79B, was associated (P {\textless} 0.05) with the unfavorable 11q deletion and also with the unfavorable Binet stages B and C. We present here gene expression profiling that is associated with CLL patients with the 11q23 deletion. Many of the genes in the cluster have not previously been shown to be related to the initiation or progression of CLL. These novel findings provide fundamental information for further attempts to understand the interaction of the clustered genes in the leukomogenesis of CLL in order to better design treatments aimed at specific molecular target(s).},

In an attempt to distinguish between these two alternatives, 1-(phosphoribosyl)barbituric acid was synthesized with 13C at the 5-position. Interaction of this potential transition-state analogue inhibitor with yeast orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase resulted in a small (0.6 ppm) downfield displacement of the C-5 resonance, indicating no rehybridization of the kind that might have been expected to accompany 5,6-addition of an enzyme nucleophile. When the substrate orotidine 5'-monophosphate was synthesized with deuterium at C-5, no significant change in kcat (H/D = 0.99 +/- 0.06) or kcat/KM (H/D = 1.00 +/- 0.06) was found to result, suggesting that C-5 does not undergo significant changes in geometry before or during the step that determines the rate of the catalytic process. These results are consistent with a nitrogen ylide mechanism and offer no support for the intervention of covalently bound intermediates in the catalytic process.},

Yet enzymatic conversion of both epimers of the hydrate to NADH was found to proceed essentially to completion in the presence of ATP and dehydratase.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Profile hidden Markov models provide a sensitive method for performing sequence database search and aligning multiple sequences. One of the drawbacks of the hidden Markov model is that the conserved amino acids are not emphasized, but signal and noise are treated equally. For this reason, the number of estimated emission parameters is often enormous. Focusing the analysis on conserved residues only should increase the accuracy of sequence database search. RESULTS: We address this issue with a new method for efficient emission probability (EEP) estimation, in which amino acids are divided into effective and ineffective residues at each conserved alignment position. A practical study with 20 protein families demonstrated that the EEP method is capable of detecting family members from other proteins with sensitivity of 98\% and specificity of 99\% on the average, even if the number of free emission parameters was decreased to 15\% of the original. In the database search for TIM barrel sequences, EEP recognizes the family members nearly as accurately as HMMER or Blast, but the number of false positive sequences was significantly less than that obtained with the other methods.

	abstract = {The assessment of residue conservation in a multiple sequence alignment is a central issue in bioinformatics. Conserved residues and regions are used to determine structural and functional motifs or evolutionary relationships between the sequences of a multiple sequence alignment. For this reason, residue conservation is a valuable measure for database and motif search or for estimating the quality of alignments. In this paper, we present statistical methods for identifying conserved residues in multiple sequence alignments. While most earlier studies examine the positional conservation of the alignment, we focus on the detection of individual conserved residues at a position. The major advantages of multiple comparison methods originate from their ability to select conserved residues simultaneously and to consider the variability of the residue estimates. Large-scale simulations were used for the comparative analysis of the methods. Practical performance was studied by comparing the structurally and functionally important residues of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains to the assignments of the conservation indices. The applicability of the indices was also compared in three additional protein families comprising different degrees of entropy and variability in alignment positions. The results indicate that statistical multiple comparison methods are sensitive and reliable in identifying conserved residues.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment is the foundation of many important applications in bioinformatics that aim at detecting functionally important regions, predicting protein structures, building phylogenetic trees etc. Although the automatic construction of a multiple sequence alignment for a set of remotely related sequences cause a very challenging and error-prone task, many downstream analyses still rely heavily on the accuracy of the alignments. RESULTS: To address the need for an objective evaluation framework, we introduce a statistical score that assesses the quality of a given multiple sequence alignment. The quality assessment is based on counting the number of significantly conserved positions in the alignment using importance sampling method in conjunction with statistical profile analysis framework. We first evaluate a novel objective function used in the alignment quality score for measuring the positional conservation. The results for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, Ras-like proteins, peptidase M13, subtilase and beta-lactamase families demonstrate that the score can distinguish sequence patterns with different degrees of conservation. Secondly, we evaluate the quality of the alignments produced by several widely used multiple sequence alignment programs using a novel alignment quality score and a commonly used sum of pairs method. According to these results, the Mafft strategy L-INS-i outperforms the other methods, although the difference between the Probcons, TCoffee and Muscle is mostly insignificant. The novel alignment quality score provides similar results than the sum of pairs method. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the proposed statistical score is useful in assessing the quality of multiple sequence alignments.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an essential prerequisite for many sequence analysis methods and valuable tool itself for describing relationships between protein sequences. Since the success of the sequence analysis is highly dependent on the reliability of alignments, measures for assessing the quality of alignments are highly requisite. RESULTS: We present a statistical model-based alignment quality score. Unlike other quality scores, it does not require several parallel alignments for the same set of sequences or additional structural information. Our quality score is based on measuring the conservation level of reference alignments in Homstrad. Reference sequences were realigned with the Mafft, Muscle and Probcons alignment programs, and a sum-of-pairs (SP) score was used to measure the quality of the realignments. Statistical modelling of the SP score as a function of conservation level and other alignment characteristics makes it possible to predict the SP score for any global MSA. The predicted SP scores are highly correlated with the correct SP scores, when tested on the Homstrad and SABmark databases. The results are comparable to that of multiple overlap score (MOS) and better than those of normalized mean distance (NorMD) and normalized iRMSD (NiRMSD) alignment quality criteria. Furthermore, the predicted SP score is able to detect alignments with badly aligned or unrelated sequences. AVAILABILITY: The method is freely available at http://www.mtt.fi/AlignmentQuality/.},

Since TENS acts through central mechanisms, we hypothesized that TENS will reduce chronic bilateral hyperalgesia produced by unilateral inflammation when applied either ipsilateral or contralateral to the site of muscle inflammation. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with carrageenan in the left gastrocnemius muscle belly. Mechanical withdrawal threshold was tested bilaterally before and 2 weeks after carrageenan injection. After testing withdrawal thresholds at 2 weeks, rats received TENS treatment either ipsilateral or contralateral to the site of inflammation. In each of these groups, rats were randomized to control (no TENS), low frequency (4 Hz), or high frequency (100 Hz) TENS treatment. TENS was applied for 20 min at sensory intensity under light halothane anesthesia. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were re-assessed after TENS or 'no TENS' treatment. Unilateral injection of carrageenan to the gastrocnemius muscle significantly reduced the mechanical withdrawal threshold (mechanical hyperalgesia) bilaterally 2 weeks later. Either low or high frequency TENS applied to the gastrocnemius muscle ipsilateral to the site of inflammation significantly reversed mechanical hyperalgesia, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the site of inflammation. Low or high frequency TENS applied to the gastrocnemius muscle contralateral to the site of inflammation also significantly reduced mechanical hyperalgesia, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the site of inflammation. Since ipsilateral or contralateral TENS treatments were effective in reducing chronic bilateral hyperalgesia in this animal model, we suggest that TENS act through modulating descending influences from supraspinal sites such as rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM).},

The diagnosis and treatment of patients would benefit from knowing which variants are disease related. Bioinformatic approaches are well suited to the problem and can handle large numbers of cases. Functional effects were revealed based on literature for 168 MMR missense variants. Performance of numerous prediction methods was tested with this dataset. Among the tested tools, only the results of tolerance prediction methods correlated to functional information, however, with poor performance. Therefore, a novel consensus-based predictor was developed. The novel prediction method, pathogenic-or-not mismatch repair (PON-MMR), achieved accuracy of 0.87 and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.77 on the experimentally verified variants. When applied to 616 MMR cases with unknown effects, 81 missense variants were predicted to be pathogenic and 167 neutral. With PON-MMR, the number of MMR missense variants with unknown effect was reduced by classifying a large number of cases as likely pathogenic or benign. The results can be used, for example, to prioritize cases for experimental studies and assist in the classification of cases.},

	abstract = {Many proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions, which may be crucial for function, but on the other hand be related to the pathogenicity of variants. Prediction programs have been developed to detect disordered regions from sequences and used to predict the consequences of variants, although their performance for this task has not been assessed. We tested the performance of protein disorder prediction programs in detecting changes to disorder caused by amino acid substitutions. We assessed the performance of 29 protein disorder predictors and versions with 101 amino acid substitutions, whose effects have been experimentally validated. Disorder predictors detected the true positives at most with 6\% success rate and true negatives with 34\% rate for variants. The corresponding rates for the wild-type forms are 7\% and 90\%, respectively. The analysis revealed that disorder programs cannot reliably predict the effects of substitutions; consequently, the tested methods, and possibly similar programs, cannot be recommended for variant analysis without other information indicating to the relevance of disorder. These results inspired us to develop a new method, PON-Diso (http://structure.bmc.lu.se/PON-Diso), for disorder-related amino acid substitutions. With 50\% success rate for independent test set and 70.5\% rate in cross-validation, it outperforms the evaluated methods.},

METHODS: In this trial, we compared the safety and immunogenicity of a new, chromatographically purified rabies vaccine (CPRV) with those of HDCV. One hundred and thirty-five healthy veterinary students were randomized in a 2:1 ratio between CPRV and HDCV respectively. Each student subsequently received an intramuscular injection of 0.5 mL of CPRV or 1mL of HDCV on days 0, 7, and 28, according to the standard preexposure regimen. Local safety data were collected for 7 days following each dose and systemic safety data for 42 days following the first dose. Vaccine administration and safety evaluation were performed by different site personnel. Sera for immunogenicity analysis were collected on days 0 (prevaccination), 28 and 42. RESULTS: All subjects achieved an antirabies antibody titer greater than or equal to the World Health Organization (WHO) accepted threshold level of seroconversion of 0.5 IU/mL after only two of three doses of vaccine in both groups. The geometric mean titers (IU/mL) in the CPRV and HDCV groups respectively were 6.54 (range 0.50 to 64.80) and 10.22 (range 0.70 to 51.40) on day 28, and 40.51 (range 5.40 to 278.00) and 37.71 (range 5.40 to 278.00) on day 42. The percentage of subjects experiencing local reactions within 3 days after any dose ranged from 65.2\% to 80.9\% in the CPRV group and from 77.3\% to 84.4\% in the HDCV group. The local reaction reported by the greatest percentage of subjects after each dose was pain/tenderness at the injection site, and most reactions were mild. Most of the reported local reactions resolved within 0 to 3 days postvaccination. Systemic reactions decreased from 76.4\% after dose 1 to 36.0\% after dose 3 in the CPRV group, and similarly from 55.6\% to 31.8\% in the HDCV group. For all postdose periods, the systemic reaction reported by the highest percentage of subjects was myalgia. No subjects experienced an immediate local or systemic reaction.

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {Congenital ataxia and mental retardation are mainly caused by variations in the genes that affect brain development. Recent reports have shown that mutations in the CA8 gene are associated with mental retardation and ataxia in humans and ataxia in mice. The gene product, carbonic anhydrase-related protein VIII (CARP VIII), is predominantly present in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1, a calcium channel. In this study, we investigated the effects of the loss of function of CARP VIII during embryonic development in zebrafish using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against the CA8 gene. Knockdown of CA8 in zebrafish larvae resulted in a curved body axis, pericardial edema and abnormal movement patterns. Histologic examination revealed gross morphologic defects in the cerebellar region and in the muscle. Electron microscopy studies showed increased neuronal cell death in developing larvae injected with CA8 antisense morpholinos. These data suggest a pivotal role for CARP VIII during embryonic development. Furthermore, suppression of CA8 expression leads to defects in motor and coordination functions, mimicking the ataxic human phenotype. This work reveals an evolutionarily conserved function of CARP VIII in brain development and introduces a novel zebrafish model in which to investigate the mechanisms of CARP VIII-related ataxia and mental retardation in humans.},

Sequence information is integrated with other genomic-scale data emerging from the Plasmodium research community, including gene expression analysis from EST, SAGE and microarray projects and proteomics studies. The relational schema used to build PlasmoDB, GUS (Genomics Unified Schema) employs a highly structured format to accommodate the diverse data types generated by sequence and expression projects. A variety of tools allow researchers to formulate complex, biologically-based, queries of the database. A stand-alone version of the database is also available on CD-ROM (P. falciparum GenePlot), facilitating access to the data in situations where internet access is difficult (e.g. by malaria researchers working in the field). The goal of PlasmoDB is to facilitate utilization of the vast quantities of genomic-scale data produced by the global malaria research community.

The relative strengths of artificial secretory signals emitted from the human signal peptide HMM (SP-HMM) correlate with their HMM bit scores as determined by their effectiveness to direct alkaline phosphatase secretion. The nature of the signal strength is in effect the closeness to the consensus. The HMM bit score of 8 is experimentally determined to be the threshold for discriminating signal sequences from non-secretory ones. An artificial SP-HMM generated signal sequence of the maximum model bit score (HMM + 38) was selected as an ideal human signal sequence. This signal peptide (secrecon) directs strong protein secretion and expression. We further ranked the signal strengths of the signal peptides of the known human secretory proteins by SP-HMM bit scores. The applications of high-bit scoring HMM signals in recombinant protein production and protein engineering are discussed.},

In this study, the mechanisms that chNKG2D T cells require to induce host immunity against ovarian tumors and which of the host immune cells are involved in tumor elimination were determined. Treatment with chNKG2D T cells led to a sustained, increased IFN-gamma production by host NK, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen and at the tumor site and this continued for many weeks after T cell injection. Tumor Ag presentation was enhanced in chNKG2D T cell-treated mice, and there were greater numbers of tumor-specific T cells at the tumor site and in draining lymph nodes after treatment with chNKG2D T cells. The increase in host cell cytokine secretion and Ag presentation was dependent on chNKG2D T cell-derived perforin, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF. Host immune mechanisms were involved in tumor elimination because inhibition of tumor growth was limited in mice that lacked perforin, IFN-gamma, NK cells, or T and B cells (Rag1(-/-)). There was no role for host-derived GM-CSF or CD1-dependent NKT cells, because mice deficient in these were able to clear tumors as well as treated wild-type B6 mice. In summary, chNKG2D T cells required both cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion as well as the participation of host immune cells for development of a host antitumor immune response and complete efficacy.},

Despite increasing importance, data for long-term prognosis are scarce in pediatric presentations. The European-American-Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma-Registry, with a total of 2001 patients with confirmed paraganglial tumors, was the platform for this study. Molecular genetic and phenotypic classification and assessment of gene-specific long-term outcome with second and/or malignant paraganglial tumors and life expectancy were performed in patients diagnosed at {\textless}18 years. Of 177 eligible registrants, 80\% had mutations, 49\% VHL, 15\% SDHB, 10\% SDHD, 4\% NF1, and one patient each in RET, SDHA, and SDHC. A second primary paraganglial tumor developed in 38\% with increasing frequency over time, reaching 50\% at 30 years after initial diagnosis. Their prevalence was associated with hereditary disease (P=0.001), particularly in VHL and SDHD mutation carriers (VHL vs others, P=0.001 and SDHD vs others, P=0.042). A total of 16 (9\%) patients with hereditary disease had malignant tumors, ten at initial diagnosis and another six during follow-up. The highest prevalence was associated with SDHB (SDHB vs others, P{\textless}0.001). Eight patients died (5\%), all of whom had germline mutations. Mean life expectancy was 62 years with hereditary disease. Hereditary disease and the underlying germline mutation define the long-term prognosis of pediatric patients in terms of prevalence and time of second primaries, malignant transformation, and survival. Based on these data, gene-adjusted, specific surveillance guidelines can help effective preventive medicine.},

	abstract = {Mandelate racemase (EC 5.1.2.2) catalyzes the abstraction of a proton from a carbon atom adjacent to a carboxylate function, a reaction which is kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable. Proton NMR spectroscopy and polarimetry were used to measure the rates of deuterium incorporation into the alpha-position of mandelate and the racemization of (R)-mandelate, after samples had been incubated at elevated temperatures. Using an Arrhenius plot, the value of the free energy of activation for racemization and deuterium exchange was calculated to be 34.6 (+/-0.9) kcal/mol under neutral conditions, at 25 degrees C. This result indicates that mandelate racemase produces a remarkable rate enhancement [(1.7 x 10(15))-fold], and a level of transition state affinity (Ktx = 2 x 10(-19) M), that surpasses the levels achieved by most enzymes. Methylamine, imidazole, and acetate catalyzed the nonenzymatic hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction at 170 degrees C, and the values of the second-order rate constants are 2.8 (+/-0.2) x 10(-5), 13.4 (+/-0.7) x 10(-5), and {\textless} or = 4 (+/-1) x 10(-7) M-1 s-1, respectively. By comparing wild-type mandelate racemase's proficiency as a catalyst with the proficiencies of these small molecules which correspond to the missing pieces in the variant enzymes Lys 166 Arg [Kallarakal.

Thereby a strong dependency of signal intensity on the amount of organic solvent present in the eluent could be observed. Adding a make-up liquid (iso-propanol) post-column to the HPLC effluent greatly enhanced detection limits for early eluting compounds. Limits of detection achieved employing this approach were in the range of 7-27 mug L(-1) for the parabene test mixture and 15-87 mug L(-1) for the pharmaceuticals. In further investigations DART ionization was compared to several other widely used atmospheric pressure ionization methods with respect to signal suppression phenomena occurring in when samples with problematic matrices are analyzed. For this purpose extracts from environmental and waste water samples were selected as model matrices which were subsequently spiked with a set of six substances commonly present in personal care products as well as six pharmaceuticals at concentration levels between 100 mug L(-1) and 500 mug L(-1) corresponding to 100 ng L(-1) and 500 ng L(-1) respectively in the original sample. With ionization suppression of less than 11\% for most analytes investigated, DART ionization showed similar to even somewhat superior behavior compared to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and atmospheric pressure photo ionization (APPI) for the Danube river water extract; for the more challenging matrix of the sewage plant effluent extract DART provided better results with ion suppression being less than 11\% for 9 out of 12 analytes while values for APCI were lying between 20\% and {\textgreater}90\%. Electrospray ionization (ESI) was much more affected by suppression effects than DART with values between 26\% and 80\% for Danube river water; in combination with the sewage plant effluent matrix suppression {\textgreater}50\% was observed for all analytes.},

This addition, combined with a thorough error-correction of a new data set, have improved the performance of the predictor significantly over SignalP version 2. In version 3, correctness of the cleavage site predictions has increased notably for all three organism groups, eukaryotes, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The accuracy of cleavage site prediction has increased in the range 6-17\% over the previous version, whereas the signal peptide discrimination improvement is mainly due to the elimination of false-positive predictions, as well as the introduction of a new discrimination score for the neural network.

	abstract = {We have solved the structure of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase (CDA) complexed to the transition state analog, 5-fluoroprimidin-2-one riboside. The monomer of the alpha 2 CDA dimer is composed of a small N-terminal alpha-helical domain with no obvious connection to the active sites, and two, larger, core domains. The two core domains have nearly identical tertiary structures and are related by approximate 2-fold symmetry, but lack internal amino acid sequence homology. Comparison of the core domain structure with known structures by sequence homology and structural compatibility searches suggests that the CDA tertiary structure cannot be superimposed on any known protein structure. The two active sites per dimer are formed across the subunit interface. The N-terminal core domain provides a pyrimidine nucleoside and zinc-binding pocket and the structurally homologous C-terminal core domain in the other monomer covers this active-site cleft, completely sequestering the ligand from solvent. The deeply buried zinc-binding site is formed by a novel "topological switch point" at the amino termini of two alpha-helices in consecutive alpha-beta-alpha-beta segments. The transition state analog is bound as a covalent hydrate at C4. The inhibitor hydroxyl oxygen atom interacts both with the zinc atom and the Glu104 carboxylate group, affording high differential affinity for the hydroxyl group relative to a hydrogen atom, in a manner reminiscent of that observed in adenosine deaminase (ADA). Unlike the latter enzyme, the zinc atom is coordinated in a tetrahedral ligand field to two cysteine and one histidine ligands, plus the hydroxyl group. Moreover, the inhibitor stereochemistry is of the opposite hand from that of the corresponding ADA inhibitor at C4(R), but is the same at the hydroxyl group O4(S). A consequence of these stereochemical differences is that in CDA a single conserved carboxylate side-chain, Glu104, can provide all of the necessary proton transfer functions involved in generating the zinc hydroxide nucleophile, and protonating the pyrimidine ring nitrogen atom and leaving amino group. The differences in zinc ligands, ligand-binding stereochemistry, and tertiary structures of CDA and ADA strongly suggest that the common features of transition state stabilization arose by convergent evolution.},

	abstract = {The nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I molecule HLA-E acts as a ligand for CD94/NKG2 receptors on the surface of natural killer cells and a subset of T cells. HLA-E presents closely related nonameric peptide epitopes derived from the highly conserved signal sequences of classical major histocompatibility complex class I molecules as well as HLA-G. Their generation requires cleavage of the signal sequence by signal peptidase followed by the intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease, signal peptide peptidase. In this study, we have assessed the subsequent proteolytic requirements leading to generation of the nonameric HLA-E peptide epitopes. We show that proteasome activity is required for further processing of the peptide generated by signal peptide peptidase. This constitutes the first example of capture of a naturally derived short peptide by the proteasome, producing a class I peptide ligand.},

	abstract = {Reliable structural and statistical analyses of three dimensional protein structures should be based on unbiased data. The Protein Data Bank is highly redundant, containing several entries for identical or very similar sequences. A technique was developed for clustering the known structures based on their sequences and contents of alpha- and beta-structures. First, sequences were aligned pairwise. A representative sample of sequences was then obtained by grouping similar sequences together, and selecting a typical representative from each group. The similarity significance threshold needed in the clustering method was found by analyzing similarities of random sequences. Because three dimensional structures for proteins of same structural class are generally more conserved than their sequences, the proteins were clustered also according to their contents of secondary structural elements. The results of these clusterings indicate conservation of alpha- and beta-structures even when sequence similarity is relatively low. An unbiased sample of 103 high resolution structures, representing a wide variety of proteins, was chosen based on the suggestions made by the clustering algorithm. The proteins were divided into structural classes according to their contents and ratios of secondary structural elements. Previous classifications have suffered from subjective view of secondary structures, whereas here the classification was based on backbone geometry. The concise view lead to reclassification of some structures. The representative set of structures facilitates unbiased analyses of relationships between protein sequence, function, and structure as well as of structural characteristics.},

The new method uses representatives of nuclear families as a learning set. For the sequence to be predicted, the method produces a vector of certainty factors called a fuzzy structural vector. Validation with independent test sets shows that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method has clear dependency on the representativity of the learning set. The representatives obtained from the nuclear families of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) were shown to give accurate predictions for PDB proteins, whilst the amino acid composition-based methods used previously achieve their maximum predictability with relatively limited learning sets, and they remain inaccurate even with highly representative learning sets. The usability of the new method is increased further by the fuzzy structural vectors, which substantially reduce the risk of misclassification and realistically describe vague secondary structural tendencies.},

	abstract = {Recombinant rabbit muscle creatine kinase (CK) was titrated with MgADP in 50 mM Bicine and 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, pH 8.3, at 30.0 degrees C by following a decrease in the protein's intrinsic fluorescence. In the presence of 50 mM NaOAc, but in the absence of added creatine or nitrate, MgADP has an apparent K(d) of 135 +/- 7 microM, and the total change in fluorescence on saturation (Delta\%F) is 15.3 +/- 0.3\%. Acetate was used as the anion in this experiment because it does not promote the formation of a CK.MgADP.anion.creatine transition-state analogue complex (TSAC) [Millner-White and Watts (1971) Biochem. J. 122, 727-740]. In the presence of 80 mM creatine, but no nitrate, the apparent K(d) for MgADP remains essentially unchanged at 132 +/- 10 microM, while Delta\%F decreases slightly to 13.2 +/- 0.3\%. In the presence of 10 mM nitrate, but no creatine, the apparent K(d) is once again essentially unchanged at 143 +/- 23 microM, but the Delta\%F is markedly reduced to 4.2 +/- 0.2\%. The presence of both 10 mM nitrate and 80 mM creatine during titration reduces the apparent K(d) for MgADP 10-fold to 13.7 +/- 0.7 microM, and Delta\%F increases to 20.6 +/- 0.3\%, strongly suggesting that the simultaneous presence of saturating levels of creatine and nitrate increases the affinity of CK for MgADP and promotes the formation of the enzyme*MgADP*nitrate*creatine TSAC. When the fluorescence of CK was titrated with MgADP in the presence of 80 mM creatine and fixed saturating concentrations of various anions, apparent K(d) values for MgADP of 132 +/- 10 microM, 25.2 +/- 1.3 microM, 18.8 +/- 0.9 microM, 13.7 +/- 0.7 microM, and 6.4 +/- 0.7 microM were observed as the anion was changed from acetate to formate to chloride to nitrate to nitrite, respectively. This is the same trend reported by Millner-White and Watts for the effectiveness of various monovalent anions in forming the CK.MgADP.anion.creatine TSAC. On titration of CK with MgADP in the presence of 80 mM creatine and various fixed concentrations of NaNO3, the apparent K(d) for MgADP decreases with increasing fixed concentrations of nitrate. A plot of the apparent K(d) for MgADP vs [NO3-] suggests a K(d) for nitrate from the TSAC of 0.39 +/- 0.07 mM. Similarly, titration with MgADP in the presence of 10 mM NaNO3 and various fixed concentrations of creatine gives a value of 0.9 +/- 0.4 mM for the dissociation of creatine from the TSAC. The data were used to calculate K(TDAC), the dissociation constant of the quaternary TSAC into its individual components, of 3 x 10(-10) M3. To our knowledge this is the first reported dissociation constant for a ternary or quaternary TSAC.},

In experiment 1, a total of 3,900 turkey eggs (1,300 per group) were injected at 25 d of incubation with either 200 muL of a control (physiological saline) solution or a dextrin solution (18\% maltodextrin and 10\% potato starch dextrin) with 75 or 375 mug/mL of iodinated casein (DexIC75 or DexIC375, where Dex and IC refer to dextrin and iodinated casein, respectively). Two hundred poults from each group were neck-tagged, weighed (hatch weight), placed in a commercial turkey house within a single brooder ring, and weighed again (7 d posthatch). In experiment 2, a total of 5,200 eggs (2,600 per group) were injected with the control or DexIC75 solution. A total of 600 poults (300 per group) were neck-tagged and hatch weights were obtained, followed by placement in a single brooder ring in a commercial house and a second weighing (6 d posthatch). Eggs in experiments 1 and 2 were obtained from hen flocks that were 33 and 5 wk into the laying cycle, respectively. In experiment 1, the DexIC75 injection resulted in a 1.8\% increase (P = 0.03) in hatch weight. In experiment 2, the DexIC75 treatment resulted in a 2.4\% increase in hatchability (P = 0.01), a 4.3\% increase in hatch weight (P {\textless} 0.001), and a 1.8\% increase in 6-d poult weights (P {\textless} 0.03) compared with controls.

Based on the behavior of a model compound, 6-cyano-1,3-dimethyluracil, and on vibrational calculations, the observed change in stretching frequency is attributed to desolvation of the ligand, and distortion of the ligand in which the nitrile group moves out of the plane of the pyrimidine ring.

Every member of the methylamine series is found to yield other members of the methylamine series. When the total concentration of amine was held constant and the rate of reaction was examined as a function of changing pH using the amine itself as the buffer, the initial rate of appearance of the products was found to reach a maximum when the conjugate acid and the conjugate base were present at equivalent concentrations. Near this equivalence point, the rate of reaction varied with pH as expected for a second-order reaction between the protonated and the unprotonated species. Under similar conditions, methyl groups were also found to migrate between the nitrogen atoms of N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine in a first-order process. With dimethylamine as a common acceptor, trimethylsulfonium ion was found to be approximately 104-fold more reactive than the tetramethylammonium ion at ambient temperature.},

A Bronsted plot of the observed rates of decarboxylation of these and other ionized carboxylic acids, as a function of the pKC-H values of the carbon acids generated by their decarboxylation, exhibits a betalg value of 0.7, indicating that the structures of the transition states for decarboxylation of the carboxylate forms of these acids approaches the structures of the carbanions generated by their decarboxylation. On the basis of an estimated pKC-H value for benzene in water ( approximately 43), extrapolation of that Bronsted plot leads to the prediction that benzoate decarboxylation should proceed at detectable rates in water at temperatures below the critical point. That prediction was confirmed experimentally. Using this same relationship, and extrapolating to the observed rate constant for enzymatic decarboxylation of orotidine 5'-monophosphate, we estimate that the "effective" pKa value of the 6-CH group of uridine 5'-monophosphate, the product of decarboxylation, is 9.5 at the active site of yeast OMP decarboxylase.},

Quantum mechanical simulations have been interpreted as indicating that urea hydrolysis is extremely slow, compared with other biological reactions proceeding spontaneously, and that urease surpasses all other enzymes in its power to enhance the rate of a reaction. We tested that possibility experimentally by examining the hydrolysis of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylurea, from which elimination cannot occur. In neutral solution at 25 degrees C, the rate constant for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of tetramethylurea is 4.2 x 10-12 s-1, which does not differ greatly from the rate constants observed for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of acetamide (5.1 x 10-11 s-1) or N,N-dimethylacetamide (1.8 x 10-11 s-1) under the same conditions. We estimate that the proficiency of urease as a catalyst, (kcat/Km)/knon, is 8 x 1017 M-1, slightly higher than the values for other metalloenzymes (carboxypeptidase b and cytidine deaminase) that catalyze the hydrolysis of similar bonds.},

	abstract = {We have demonstrated that T3 increases the expression of ZAKI-4alpha, an endogenous calcineurin inhibitor. In this study we characterized a T3-dependent signaling cascade leading to ZAKI-4alpha expression in human skin fibroblasts. We found that T3-dependent increase in ZAKI-4alpha was greatly attenuated by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of a protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), suggesting the requirement of mTOR activation by T3. Indeed, T3 activated mTOR rapidly through S2448 phosphorylation, leading to the phosphorylation of p70(S6K), a substrate of mTOR. This mTOR activation is mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) signaling cascade because T3 induced Akt/PKB phosphorylation more rapidly than that of mTOR, and these T3-dependent phosphorylations were blocked by both PI3K inhibitors and by expression of a dominant negative PI3K (Deltap85alpha). Furthermore, the association between thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1) and PI3K-regulatory subunit p85alpha, and the inhibition of T3-induced PI3K activation and mTOR phosphorylation by a dominant negative TR (G345R) demonstrated the involvement of TR in this T3 action. The liganded TR induces the activation of PI3K and Akt/PKB, leading to the nuclear translocation of the latter, which subsequently phosphorylates nuclear mTOR. The rapid activation of PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR-p70(S6K) cascade by T3 provides a new molecular mechanism for thyroid hormone action.},

	volume = {37},
	abstract = {The binding properties of substrates and competitive inhibitors of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase are compared with those of the fragments obtained by cutting these ligands at several positions including the glycosidic bond. In contrast with the normal substrate cytidine (kcat/Km = 2.6 x 10(6) M-1 s-1), cytosine is found to serve as an extremely slow substrate (kcat/Km = 1.8 x 10(-3) M-1 s-1), despite the ability of cytosine to enter any active site that can accommodate the normal substrate cytidine. Spontaneous nonenzymatic deamination proceeds at similar rates for cytosine and cytidine at pH 7 and 25 degrees C, indicating that substituent ribose exerts little effect on the intrinsic reactivity of cytidine in solution. Dividing knon by kcat/Km, the maximal Kd value of the enzyme's complex with the altered substrate in the transition state is estimated as 6.1 x 10(-8) M for cytosine, very much higher than the value (1.2 x 10(-16) M) estimated for cytidine. The Kd value of ribofuranose, the missing substituent, is roughly 1.8 x 10(-2) M, as indicated by the Ki values of D-ribose and 1-methyl-D-ribofuranoside as competitive inhibitors. Thus, the free energy of binding of the altered substrate in the transition state is 9.5 kcal/mol more favorable for the whole molecule cytidine than for the sum of those of its parts, cytosine plus ribofuranose. As a separate molecule, however, ribose shows no detectable effect on the enzyme's activity on cytosine. Connectivity effects of similar magnitude are indicated by the equilibrium binding affinities of inhibitors. Thus, the Ki value of the transition state analogue inhibitor zebularine hydrate (1.2 x 10(-12) M) is very much lower than the combined affinities of N-ribofuranosylurea (1.6 x 10(-4) M) and allyl alcohol (0.14 M), indicating that the glycoside bond, by its presence, exerts a connectivity effect of 9.9 kcal/mol on the observed free energy of binding.},

	abstract = {Cytidine deaminase from E. coli is a dimer of identical subunits (M(r) = 31 540), each containing a single zinc atom. Cytidine deaminase from B. subtilis is a tetramer of identical subunits (M(r) = 14 800). After purification from an overexpressing strain, the enzyme from B. subtilis is found to contain a single atom of zinc per enzyme subunit by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Fluorescence titration indicates that each of the four subunits contains a binding site for the transition state analogue inhibitor 5-fluoro-3,4-dihydrouridine. A region of amino acid sequence homology, containing residues that are involved in zinc coordination in the enzyme from E. coli, strongly suggests that in the enzyme from B. subtilis, zinc is coordinated by the thiolate side chains of three cysteine residues (Cys-53, Cys-86, and Cys-89) [Song, B. H., and Neuhard, J. (1989) Mol. Gen. Genet. 216, 462-468]. This pattern of zinc coordination appears to be novel for a hydrolytic enzyme, and might be expected to reduce the reactivity of the active site substantially compared with that of the enzyme from E. coli (His-102, Cys-129, and Cys-132). Instead, the B. subtilis and E. coli enzymes are found to be similar in their activities, and also in their relative binding affinities for a series of structurally related inhibitors with binding affinities that span a range of 6 orders of magnitude. In addition, the apparent pK(a) value of the active site is shifted upward by less than 1 unit. Sequence alignments, together with model building, suggest one possible mechanism of compensation.},

Comparison of pKa values of model compounds indicates that the equilibrium constant for 3,4-hydration of this inhibitor in free solution is 3.5 x 10(-4) M, so that the corrected dissociation constant of 5-fluoro-3,4-dihydrouridine from the wild-type enzyme is 3.9 x 10(-11) M. Very different behavior is observed for a mutant enzyme in which alanine replaces Glu-104 at the active site, and kcat has been reduced by a factor of 10(8). 5-[19F]Fluoropyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside is strongly fluorescent, making it possible to observe that the mutant enzyme binds this inhibitor even more tightly (Kd = 4.4 x 10(-8) M) than does the native enzyme (Kd = 1.1 x 10(-7) M). 19F-NMR indicates, however, that the E104A mutant enzyme binds the inhibitor without modification, in a form that resembles the substrate in the ground state. These results are consistent with a major role for Glu-104, not only in stabilizing the ES++ complex in the transition state, but also in destabilizing the ES complex in the ground state.},

A., Wolfenden, R., \& Carter, C. W. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 235, 635] shows the presence of an H-bond between Glu-91 and the 3'-OH group of substituent ribose, a part of the substrate that is not directly involved in its chemical transformation. To test the contribution of this interaction to transition-state stabilization, Glu-91 was converted to alanine. The mutant enzyme is very much less active than the wild-type enzyme, with a 500-fold increase in Km and a 32-fold reduction in kcat using cytidine as substrate. No change in secondary structure is evident in the circular dichroic spectrum. As measured by kcat/Km, Glu-91 thus appears to stabilize the transition state for cytidine deamination by an overall factor of 1.7 x 10(4), equivalent to -5.8 kcal/mol in free energy. To test the contribution of this interaction in the opposite sense, the 3'-OH group of the substrate was replaced by a hydrogen atom. Comparing 3'-deoxycytidine with cytidine, the native enzyme shows a 17-fold increase in Km and a 400-fold decrease in kcat, indicating that the 3'-hydroxyl group of cytidine stabilizes the transition state for deamination by an overall factor of 6.3 x 10(3), equivalent to -5.2 kcal/mol in free energy, as measured by kcat/Km. After one binding partner has been removed, however, the effect of removing the remaining partner is relatively slight. For the mutant enzyme E91A, removal of the 3'-hydroxyl group from substrate cytidine reduces kcat/Km by a factor of only 3. Complete removal of substituent ribose reduces the wild-type enzyme's kcat/Km by a factor of more than 10(8); thus, substituent ribose, although distant from the site of chemical transformation of the substrate, contributes at least 11 kcal to the free energy of stabilization of the transition state for cytidine deamination, matching the apparent contribution to transition state binding made by the 4-OH group of the pyrimidine ring, which is at the site of substrate transformation [Frick, L., Yang, C., Marquez, V.

Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the mutant enzyme's affinities for substrate cytidine and product uridine were found to have increased, whereas kcat for deamination of cytidine had been reduced by 8 orders of magnitude. By its presence, the carboxymethyl group of Glu-104 appears to minimize the activation barrier for deamination, not only by stabilizing the altered substrate in the transition state but also by destabilizing the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes.

Synthetase Urzymes acylate cognate tRNAs even without anticodon-binding domains, in keeping with the possibility that acceptor stem recognition preceded anticodon recognition. Representing tRNA identity elements with two bits per base, we show that the anticodon encodes the hydrophobicity of each amino acid side-chain as represented by its water-to-cyclohexane distribution coefficient, and this relationship holds true over the entire temperature range of liquid water. The acceptor stem codes preferentially for the surface area or size of each side-chain, as represented by its vapor-to-cyclohexane distribution coefficient. These orthogonal experimental properties are both necessary to account satisfactorily for the exposed surface area of amino acids in folded proteins. Moreover, the acceptor stem codes correctly for beta-branched and carboxylic acid side-chains, whereas the anticodon codes for a wider range of such properties, but not for size or beta-branching. These and other results suggest that genetic coding of 3D protein structures evolved in distinct stages, based initially on the size of the amino acid and later on its compatibility with globular folding in water.},

Furthermore, several cellular signaling pathways acting either in cell cycle regulation or in apoptosis were altered. Deregulation was found in pathways that contribute to genomic stability (by downregulation of either TP53 or CSE1L and by upregulation of GADD45A) and regulate cell cycle progression (by downregulation of CDKN2A and upregulation of RBBP4, CDC37, and NEDD5). Alterations at the transcriptional level were identified, namely, upregulation of JUN and E2F5. Abnormalities were observed in the regulation of the caspases through upregulation of CASP8 and by altered expression of BCL2-related pathway. Extrinsic apoptotic signals mediated by IGFs were deregulated and the glutathione detoxification pathway was downregulated.

	abstract = {Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia results from mutations in the collagen X (COL10A1) gene. With the exception of two cases, the known mutations are clustered in the C-terminal nonhelical (NC1) domain of the collagen X.In vitro and cell culture studies have shown that the NC1 mutations result in impaired collagen X trimer assembly and secretion. In the two other cases, missense mutations that alter Gly18at the −1 position of the putative signal peptide cleavage site were identified (Ikegawa, S., Nakamura, K., Nagano, A., Haga, N., and Nakamura, Y. (1997) Hum. Mutat. 9, 131–135). To study their impact on collagen X biosynthesis using in vitrocell-free translation in the presence of microsomes, and cell transfection assays, these two mutations were created inCOL10A1 by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that translocation of the mutant pre-α1(X) chains into the microsomes is not affected, but cleavage of the signal peptide is inhibited, and the mutant chains remain anchored to the membrane of microsomes. Cell-free translation and transfection studies in cells showed that the mutant chains associate into trimers but cannot form a triple helix. The combined effect of both the lack of signal peptide cleavage and helical configuration is impaired secretion. Thus, despite the different nature of the NC1 and signal peptide mutations in collagen X, both result in impaired collagen X secretion, probably followed by intracellular retention and degradation of mutant chains, and causing the Schmid metaphyseal chandrodysplasia phenotype.},

Blood samples were taken in slaughterhouses (study 1, n=2000; study 2, n=331) and in a remote village where pigs are free roaming (study 3, n=646) and examined by ELISA using excretory/secretory (E/S) antigens. Seven samples (0.35\%) in study 1 and none of the samples of study 2 were serologically positive. Thirty-seven (5.72\%) village pigs tested positive by E/S ELISA in study 3. Sero-positive results by the E/S ELISA in study 1 were confirmed by ELISA using beta-tyvelose antigen, and by immunoblot. Muscle samples taken from pigs slaughtered in the abattoir (study 2) and from animals that showed a positive serology in study 3 were examined by trichinoscopy and artificial digestion. These techniques failed to demonstrate the presence of muscle larvae. The results of this survey need confirmation, but suggest that Trichinella is present in Ecuador; however, prevalence and parasite burdens are likely to be very low. The likelihood of detecting trichinellosis are higher in traditional settings than in pigs raised on improved farms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Signal peptides (SPs) mediate the targeting of secretory precursor proteins to the correct subcellular compartments in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Identifying these transient peptides is crucial to the medical, food and beverage and biotechnology industries yet our understanding of these peptides remains limited. This paper examines the most common type of signal peptides cleavable by the endoprotease signal peptidase I (SPase I), and the residues flanking the cleavage sites of three groups of signal peptide sequences, namely (i) eukaryotes (Euk) (ii) Gram-positive (Gram+) bacteria, and (iii) Gram-negative (Gram-) bacteria.RESULTS:In this study, 2352 secretory peptide sequences from a variety of organisms with amino-terminal SPs are extracted from the manually curated SPdb database for analysis based on physicochemical properties such as pI, aliphatic index, GRAVY score, hydrophobicity, net charge and position-specific residue preferences. Our findings show that the three groups share several similarities in general, but they display distinctive features upon examination in terms of their amino acid compositions and frequencies, and various physico-chemical properties. Thus, analysis or prediction of their sequences should be separated and treated as distinct groups.CONCLUSION:We conclude that the peptide segment recognized by SPase I extends to the start of the mature protein to a limited extent, upon our survey of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage processing site. These flanking residues possibly influence the cleavage processing and contribute to non-canonical cleavage sites. Our findings are applicable in defining more accurate prediction tools for recognition and identification of cleavage site of SPs.},

	title = {Predicting eukaryotic protein subcellular location by fusing optimized evidence-theoretic {K}-{Nearest} {Neighbor} classifiers},
	volume = {5},
	abstract = {Facing the explosion of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and reliably annotating their subcellular locations. Knowledge of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful hints for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. Unfortunately, it is both expensive and time-consuming to determine the localization of an uncharacterized protein in a living cell purely based on experiments. To tackle the challenge, a novel hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. The "engine" of these basic classifiers was operated by the OET-KNN (Optimized Evidence-Theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor) rule. As a demonstration, predictions were performed with the fusion classifier for proteins among the following 16 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole, (3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7) endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) lysosome, (11) mitochondria, (12) nucleus, (13) peroxisome, (14) plasma membrane, (15) plastid, and (16) vacuole. To get rid of redundancy and homology bias, none of the proteins investigated here had {\textgreater}/=25\% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the jack-knife cross-validation test and independent dataset test were 81.6\% and 83.7\%, respectively, which were 46 approximately 63\% higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same benchmark datasets. Also, it is clearly elucidated that the overwhelmingly high success rates obtained by the fusion classifier is by no means a trivial utilization of the GO annotations as prone to be misinterpreted because there is a huge number of proteins with given accession numbers and the corresponding GO numbers, but their subcellular locations are still unknown, and that the percentage of proteins with GO annotations indicating their subcellular components is even less than the percentage of proteins with known subcellular location annotation in the Swiss-Prot database. It is anticipated that the powerful fusion classifier may also become a very useful high throughput tool in characterizing other attributes of proteins according to their sequences, such as enzyme class, membrane protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily, among many others. A web server, called "Euk-OET-PLoc", has been designed at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/euk-oet for public to predict subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins by the fusion OET-KNN classifier.},

	abstract = {Current plant genome sequencing projects have called for development of novel and powerful high throughput tools for timely annotating the subcellular location of uncharacterized plant proteins. In view of this, an ensemble classifier, Plant-PLoc, formed by fusing many basic individual classifiers, has been developed for large-scale subcellular location prediction for plant proteins. Each of the basic classifiers was engineered by the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) rule. Plant-PLoc discriminates plant proteins among the following 11 subcellular locations: (1) cell wall, (2) chloroplast, (3) cytoplasm, (4) endoplasmic reticulum, (5) extracell, (6) mitochondrion, (7) nucleus, (8) peroxisome, (9) plasma membrane, (10) plastid, and (11) vacuole. As a demonstration, predictions were performed on a stringent benchmark dataset in which none of the proteins included has {\textgreater} or =25\% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location to avoid the homology bias. The overall success rate thus obtained was 32-51\% higher than the rates obtained by the previous methods on the same benchmark dataset. The essence of Plant-PLoc in enhancing the prediction quality and its significance in biological applications are discussed. Plant-PLoc is accessible to public as a free web-server at: (http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/plant). Furthermore, for public convenience, results predicted by Plant-PLoc have been provided in a downloadable file at the same website for all plant protein entries in the Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations, or are annotated as being uncertain. The large-scale results will be updated twice a year to include new entries of plant proteins and reflect the continuous development of Plant-PLoc.},

The new predictor is called Signal-CF, where C stands for "coupling" and F for "fusion", meaning that Signal-CF is formed by incorporating the subsite coupling effects along a protein sequence and by fusing the results derived from many width-different scaled windows through a voting system.

	abstract = {A protein is usually classified into one of the following five structural classes: alpha, beta, alpha + beta, alpha/beta, and zeta (irregular). The structural class of a protein is correlated with its amino acid composition. However, given the amino acid composition of a protein, how may one predict its structural class? Various efforts have been made in addressing this problem. This review addresses the progress in this field, with the focus on the state of the art, which is featured by a novel prediction algorithm and a recently developed database. The novel algorithm is characterized by a covariance matrix that takes into account the coupling effect among different amino acid components of a protein. The new database was established based on the requirement that the classes should have (1) as many nonhomologous structures as possible, (2) good quality structure, and (3) typical or distinguishable features for each of the structural classes concerned. The very high success rate for both the training-set proteins and the testing-set proteins, which has been further validated by a simulated analysis and a jackknife analysis, indicates that it is possible to predict the structural class of a protein according to its amino acid composition if an ideal and complete database can be established. It also suggests that the overall fold of a protein is basically determined by its amino acid composition.},

@article{cilingir_apicoap:_2012,
	title = {{ApicoAP}: the first computational model for identifying apicoplast-targeted proteins in multiple species of {Apicomplexa}},
	volume = {7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa contain a relict prokaryotic-derived plastid called the apicoplast. This organelle is important not only for the survival of the parasite, but its unique properties make it an ideal drug target. The majority of apicoplast-associated proteins are nuclear encoded and targeted post-translationally to the organellar lumen via a bipartite signaling mechanism that requires an N-terminal signal and transit peptide (TP). Attempts to define a consensus motif that universally identifies apicoplast TPs have failed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we propose a generalized rule-based classification model to identify apicoplast-targeted proteins (ApicoTPs) that use a bipartite signaling mechanism. Given a training set specific to an organism, this model, called ApicoAP, incorporates a procedure based on a genetic algorithm to tailor a discriminating rule that exploits the known characteristics of ApicoTPs. Performance of ApicoAP is evaluated for four labeled datasets of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium yoelii, Babesia bovis, and Toxoplasma gondii proteins. ApicoAP improves the classification accuracy of the published dataset for P. falciparum to 94\%, originally 90\% using PlasmoAP. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We present a parametric model for ApicoTPs and a procedure to optimize the model parameters for a given training set. A major asset of this model is that it is customizable to different parasite genomes. The ApicoAP prediction software is available at http://code.google.com/p/apicoap/ and http://bcb.eecs.wsu.edu.},

	abstract = {For pharmaceutical products, one approach developed to assure that different chromatographic systems are capable of generating valid results is the system suitability test. Typically, a system suitability test involves numerical limits for predefined chromatographic parameters such as theoretical plates, tailing factor, injector reproducibility, etc. An estimation of the ratio of signal compared to baseline is one way to measure system performance, according to a valid method, independent of the instrument. However, since this comparison relates the height of the signal to the height of the noise, it is difficult to relate to the peak area measurements that are typically used for quantification of samples. Additionally, although peak area and peak height may be highly correlated over a wide region, peak area at very low concentrations can be more sensitive to all components of noise due to peak shape. To establish a system suitability criterion, one can use the ratio of the area signal to the baseline noise for replicate injections for samples prepared at concentration equal to the limit of quantitation during the validation studies. A lower limit for this ratio can be derived using statistical tolerance intervals. This lower limit can be applied as a system suitability criterion to measure that any system is performing adequately for measuring low level components in the sample for all future use of the method.},

As the number of new genomes has dramatically increased over recent years, a reliable and efficient system to predict protein subcellular location is urgently needed. RESULTS: Esub8 was developed to predict protein subcellular localizations for eukaryotic proteins based on amino acid composition. In this research, the proteins are classified into the following eight groups: chloroplast, cytoplasm, extracellular, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, mitochondria, nucleus and peroxisome. We know subcellular localization is a typical classification problem; consequently, a one-against-one (1-v-1) multi-class support vector machine was introduced to construct the classifier. Unlike previous methods, ours considers the order information of protein sequences by a different method. Our method is tested in three subcellular localization predictions for prokaryotic proteins and four subcellular localization predictions for eukaryotic proteins on Reinhardt's dataset. The results are then compared to several other methods. The total prediction accuracies of two tests are both 100\% by a self-consistency test, and are 92.9\% and 84.14\% by the jackknife test, respectively. Esub8 also provides excellent results: the total prediction accuracies are 100\% by a self-consistency test and 87\% by the jackknife test. CONCLUSIONS: Our method represents a different approach for predicting protein subcellular localization and achieved a satisfactory result; furthermore, we believe Esub8 will be a useful tool for predicting protein subcellular localizations in eukaryotic organisms.},

	abstract = {Biological prediction of transcription factor binding sites and their corresponding transcription factor target genes (TFTGs) makes great contribution to understanding the gene regulatory networks. However, these approaches are based on laborious and time-consuming biological experiments. Numerous computational approaches have shown great potential to circumvent laborious biological methods. However, the majority of these algorithms provide limited performances and fail to consider the structural property of the datasets. We proposed a refined systematic computational approach for predicting TFTGs. Based on previous work done on identifying auxin response factor target genes from Arabidopsis thaliana co-expression data, we adopted a novel reverse-complementary distance-sensitive n-gram profile algorithm. This algorithm converts each upstream sub-sequence into a high-dimensional vector data point and transforms the prediction task into a classification problem using support vector machine-based classifier. Our approach showed significant improvement compared to other computational methods based on the area under curve value of the receiver operating characteristic curve using 10-fold cross validation. In addition, in the light of the highly skewed structure of the dataset, we also evaluated other metrics and their associated curves, such as precision-recall curves and cost curves, which provided highly satisfactory results.},

With the goal of establishing a model to study the mechanisms by which COMP mutations cause disease, we have analyzed synthesis and secretion of COMP in cultured chondrocytes, tendon, and ligament cells. Pentameric protein detected inside of control cells suggested that pentamerization is an intracellular process. Patient cells expressed mutant and normal RNA and secreted COMP at levels similar to controls, suggesting that abnormal pentamers are likely to be found in the extracellular matrix. Inclusions within patient cartilage stained with anti-COMP antibodies, and cultured cells presented similar inclusions, indicating that presumably abnormal COMP pentamers are less efficiently secreted than normal molecules. We conclude that the COMP disorders are likely to result from a combination of a decreased amount of COMP in the matrix and a dominant negative effect due to the presence of abnormal pentamers in cartilage.},

This retrospective study evaluated the outcome of a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine ('CVD-regimen'), which has previously been suggested for treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas. METHODS: 9 patients (5 males; age 55.0 +/- 4.0 years) with MTC were enrolled. Prior to chemotherapy, progressive disease was established in all patients by use of WHO criteria. On day 1 of each cycle, patients started with cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2), and dacarbazine 600 mg/m(2); on day 2, patients received dacarbazine alone (600 mg/m(2)). Treatment cycles were repeated at 21-day intervals and 6 cycles were planned for each patient. The standard imaging procedure was computed tomography, and the primary end point was the objective tumor response rate. After chemotherapy, patients were followed up until progression. RESULTS: 9 patients underwent a total of 57 cycles (mean 6.3 +/- 0.3 cycles). Treatment responses were: 0\% complete response, 11\% partial response, 56\% stable disease, and 33\% progressive disease. The median progression free survival was 13.6 months (range 5.8-24.2 months). The median change (baseline vs. end of treatment) of calcitonin was -19\% (range -70\% to +174\%). Reversible myelosuppression and moderate gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSION: Although objective tumor response rates were low, the CVD regimen allowed disease stabilization for a substantial period of time and had acceptable toxicity. After initial surgery, chemotherapy may therefore be considered as a medical treatment option.},

We develop a method which is based on an extended version of pseudo-amino acid composition to predict the protein localization within mitochondria. This work goes one step further than predicting protein subcellular location. We also try to predict the membrane protein type for mitochondrial inner membrane proteins. RESULTS: By using leave-one-out cross validation, the prediction accuracy is 85.5\% for inner membrane, 94.5\% for matrix and 51.2\% for outer membrane. The overall prediction accuracy for submitochondria location prediction is 85.2\%. For proteins predicted to localize at inner membrane, the accuracy is 94.6\% for membrane protein type prediction. CONCLUSION: Our method is an effective method for predicting protein submitochondria location. But even with our method or the methods at subcellular level, the prediction of protein submitochondria location is still a challenging problem.

Deiodinases (DIOs) are selenoproteins involved in thyroid hormone metabolism. We identified three of seven siblings with clinical evidence of abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism. Their fibroblasts showed decreased DIO2 enzymatic activity not linked to the DIO2 locus. Systematic linkage analysis of genes involved in DIO2 synthesis and degradation led to the identification of an inherited Sec incorporation defect, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in SECISBP2 (also called SBP2). An unrelated child with a similar phenotype was compound heterozygous with respect to mutations in SECISBP2. Because SBP2 is epistatic to selenoprotein synthesis, these defects had a generalized effect on selenoproteins. Incomplete loss of SBP2 function probably causes the mild phenotype.},

This decrease in kcat/Km appears to be related to diminished water content in the presence of each of these cosolvents. No agreement between cosolvents is observed if enzyme activity is plotted as a function of viscosity or dielectric constant; nor do these cosolvents act as conventional reversible inhibitors. The Km value of adenosine and the Ki values of a substrate analogue (6-dimethylaminopurine ribonucleoside) and a powerful competitive inhibitor (6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside) increase with decreasing solvent water content, but kcat is unaffected. Values of 1/Km and 1/Ki increase with roughly the 9th power of the concentration of water and show no sign of approaching a maximum value as the concentration of water approaches 55 M. These results are consistent with an equilibrium between an abundant, inactive, relatively dehydrated form of the enzyme and a rare, relatively hydrated form of the enzyme. Only the hydrated form of the enzyme, containing at least nine more water molecules than the dehydrated form, appears to be capable of binding substrates or competitive inhibitors. Possible physiological consequences of this behavior, in a tissue in which water is transported in large quantities, are considered.},

	abstract = {As benchmarks for judging the catalytic power of sulfate monoesterases, we sought to determine the rates of spontaneous hydrolysis of unactivated alkyl sulfate monoesters by S-O bond cleavage. Neopentyl sulfate proved to be unsuitable for this purpose, since it was found to undergo hydrolysis by a C-O bond cleaving mechanism with rearrangement of its carbon skeleton. Instead, we examined the temperature dependence of the spontaneous hydrolyses of aryl sulfate monoesters, which proceed by S-O cleavage. Extrapolation of a Bronsted plot [log(k(25)(N)) = (-1.81 +/- 0.09) pK(a)(LG) + (3.6 +/- 0.7)] based on the rate constants at 25 degrees C for hydrolysis of a series of sulfate monoesters to a pK(a)(LG) value of 16.1, typical of an aliphatic alcohol, yields k(25)(N) = 3 x 10(-26) s(-1). Comparison of that value with established k(cat) values of bacterial sulfatases indicates that these enzymes produce rate enhancements (k(cat)/k(uncat)) of up to 2 x 10(26)-fold for the hydrolysis of sulfate monoesters. These rate enhancements surpass by several orders of magnitude the 10(21)-fold rate enhancements that are generated by phosphohydrolases, the most powerful biological catalysts previously known. The hydrolytic rates of phosphate and sulfate monoesters are compared directly, and the misleading impression that the two classes of ester are of similar reactivity is dispelled.},

Remarkably, this proton transfer is estimated to accelerate the decomposition of 1 by a factor of 10(11). Examination of existing kinetic data reveals that the sulfatase PaAstA catalyzes the hydrolysis of sulfamate esters with catalytic rate accelerations of 10(4), whereas the catalytic rate acceleration generated by the enzyme for its cognate substrate is on the order of 10(15).

The expression of CRY1, PER1, and PER2 was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 116 CLL patients. The expression at sequential time points over a 24-h period was measured in six CLL patients and six normal donors. We confirmed the differential expression of CRY1 in ZAP-70(+)/CD38(+) and ZAP-70(-)/CD38(-) CLL samples. Subgroups formed according to CRY1 expression levels differed significantly in time to treatment. This difference was even more pronounced for subgroups stratified by a CRY1 : PER2 expression ratio and the ratio was an independent prognostic marker in a multivariate model. Furthermore, our data indicate disturbances in the periodic expression of circadian genes in CLL cells. Because of their role in the expression of cell cycle-related and DNA-damage response genes, we suggest that the deregulated expression of circadian genes may be linked to the molecular pathogenesis of CLL.},

	abstract = {Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS) is a rare condition with clinical features of both neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Noonan syndrome (NS). All three syndromes belong to the RASopathies, which are caused by dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. The major gene involved in NFNS is NF1, but co-occurring NF1 and PTPN11 mutations in NFNS have been reported. Knowledge about possible involvement of additional RASopathy-associated genes in NFNS is, however, very limited. We present a comprehensive clinical and molecular analysis of eight affected individuals from three unrelated families displaying features of NF1 and NFNS. The genetic etiology of the clinical phenotypes was investigated by mutation analysis, including NF1, PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, RAF1, SHOC2, SPRED1, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, and CBL. All three families harbored a heterozygous NF1 variant, where the first family had a missense variant, c.5425C{\textgreater}T;p.R1809C, the second family a recurrent 4bp-deletion, c.6789\_6792delTTAC;p.Y2264Tfs*6, and the third family a splice-site variant, c.2991-1G{\textgreater}A, resulting in skipping of exon 18 and an in-frame deletion of 41 amino acids. These NF1 variants have all previously been reported in NF1 patients. Surprisingly, both c.6789\_6792delTTAC and c.2991-1G{\textgreater}A are frequently associated with NF1, but association to NFNS has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. Our results support the notion that NFNS represents a variant of NF1, genetically distinct from NS, and is caused by mutations in NF1, some of which also cause classical NF1. Due to phenotypic overlap between NFNS and NS, we propose screening for NF1 mutations in NS patients, preferentially when cafe-au-lait spots are present.},

	abstract = {A neural network-based tool, TargetP, for large-scale subcellular location prediction of newly identified proteins has been developed. Using N-terminal sequence information only, it discriminates between proteins destined for the mitochondrion, the chloroplast, the secretory pathway, and "other" localizations with a success rate of 85 \% (plant) or 90 \% (non-plant) on redundancy-reduced test sets. From a TargetP analysis. of the recently sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes 2 and 4 and the Ensembl Homo sapiens protein set, we estimate that 10 \% of all plant proteins are mitochondrial and 14 \% chloroplastic, and that the abundance of secretory proteins, in both Arabidopsis and Homo, is around 10 \%. TargetP also predicts cleavage sites with levels of correctly predicted,sites ranging from approximately 40 \% to 50 \% (chloroplastic and mitochondrial presequences) to above 70 \% (secretory signal peptides).

Using cross-validation, 88\% of the sequences in our homology reduced training set were correctly classified as transit peptides or nontransit peptides. This performance level is well above that of the publicly available chloroplast localization predictor PSORT. Cleavage sites are predicted using a scoring matrix derived by an automatic motif-finding algorithm. Approximately 60\% of the known cleavage sites in our sequence collection were predicted to within +/-2 residues from the cleavage sites given in SWISS-PROT.

In man, deficient activity of this enzyme leads to aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU), a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease. Here we used affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the native AGA and its denatured subunits to establish the molecular structure and intracellular location of the enzyme in normal and AGU fibroblasts. Inactivation of the enzyme was found to coincide with the dissociation of the heterodimeric enzyme complex into subunits. Although the subunits were not linked by covalent forces, the intrapolypeptide disulphide bridges were found to be essential for the normal function of AGA. AGA was localized into lysosomes in control fibroblasts by both immunofluorescence microscopy and immuno-electron microscopy, whereas in AGU cells the location of antigen was different, suggesting that, owing to the mutation, a missing disulphide bridge, most of the enzyme molecules get retarded in the cis-Golgi region and most probably face intracellular degradation.},

The hydrolytic activity of the enzyme toward 5,6-dihydrocytidine and its potent inhibition by 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine are presumably related by the ability of the active site to stabilize structures of this kind by tight binding.

The purpose is to investigate the possibility of using MapReduce principle to speed up biomedical data mining tasks using this pharmacovigilance case as one specific example.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disturbed cellular cholesterol homeostasis may lead to accumulation of cholesterol in human atheroma plaques. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is controlled by the sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF-2) and the SREBF cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). We investigated whole genome expression in a series of human atherosclerotic samples from different vascular territories and studied whether the non-synonymous coding variants in the interacting domains of two genes, SREBF-2 1784G{\textgreater}C (rs2228314) and SCAP 2386A{\textgreater}G, are related to the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the risk of pre-hospital sudden cardiac death (SCD). METHODS: Whole genome expression profiling was completed in twenty vascular samples from carotid, aortic and femoral atherosclerotic plaques and six control samples from internal mammary arteries. Three hundred sudden pre-hospital deaths of middle-aged (33-69 years) Caucasian Finnish men were subjected to detailed autopsy in the Helsinki Sudden Death Study. Coronary narrowing and areas of coronary wall covered with fatty streaks or fibrotic, calcified or complicated lesions were measured and related to the SREBF-2 and SCAP genotypes. RESULTS: Whole genome expression profiling showed a significant (p = 0.02) down-regulation of SREBF-2 in atherosclerotic carotid plaques (types IV-V), but not in the aorta or femoral arteries (p = NS for both), as compared with the histologically confirmed non-atherosclerotic tissues. In logistic regression analysis, a significant interaction between the SREBF-2 1784G{\textgreater}C and the SCAP 2386A{\textgreater}G genotype was observed on the risk of SCD (p = 0.046). Men with the SREBF-2 C allele and the SCAP G allele had a significantly increased risk of SCD (OR 2.68, 95\% CI 1.07-6.71), compared to SCAP AA homologous subjects carrying the SREBF-2 C allele. Furthermore, similar trends for having complicated lesions and for the occurrence of thrombosis were found, although the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the allelic variants (SREBF-2 1784G{\textgreater}C and SCAP 2386A{\textgreater}G) in the cholesterol homeostasis regulating SREBF-SCAP pathway may contribute to SCD in early middle-aged men.},

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is regarded as a potential biomarker in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The relations between aberrant gene methylation and cancer development have been identified by a number of recent scientific studies. In a previous work, we used co-occurrences to mine those associations and compiled the MeInfoText 1.0 database. To reduce the amount of manual curation and improve the accuracy of relation extraction, we have now developed MeInfoText 2.0, which uses a machine learning-based approach to extract gene methylation-cancer relations. DESCRIPTION: Two maximum entropy models are trained to predict if aberrant gene methylation is related to any type of cancer mentioned in the literature. After evaluation based on 10-fold cross-validation, the average precision/recall rates of the two models are 94.7/90.1 and 91.8/90\% respectively. MeInfoText 2.0 provides the gene methylation profiles of different types of human cancer. The extracted relations with maximum probability, evidence sentences, and specific gene information are also retrievable. The database is available at http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw:8081/MeInfoText2/. CONCLUSION: The previous version, MeInfoText, was developed by using association rules, whereas MeInfoText 2.0 is based on a new framework that combines machine learning, dictionary lookup and pattern matching for epigenetics information extraction. The results of experiments show that MeInfoText 2.0 outperforms existing tools in many respects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a hybrid approach to extract gene methylation-cancer relations. It is also the first attempt to develop a gene methylation and cancer relation corpus.},

	abstract = {The observation that the local site of autoimmune responses over-expressed HLA class II led to the formulation that tissue antigen-presenting capacity contributes significantly to the mechanism of autoimmune disease perpetuation, by continually reactivating auto-antigen-reactive T lymphocytes. These in turn produce mediator molecules which maintain HLA class II expression (and hence antigen-presenting capacity) in the target tissues; and also initiate the immune and inflammatory pathways. The importance of this concept is that it provides a readily testable hypothesis that has been investigated extensively. For the thyroid diseases compelling data to support it have accumulated; in other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis the evidence is increasing. The concept also relates the human autoimmune diseases to the normal mechanisms of immune induction and immunoregulation. This highlights the areas that we do not yet understand, namely the interplay of genetic susceptibility, extrinsic agents or disorders of immune regulation which permit the autoimmune process to become sufficiently pronounced as to engender a clinical autoimmune disease. Even with our limited understanding of the disease process, it is apparent that there are many opportunities for newer approaches at therapy, based on interfering with the immune cells or their mediators.},

Five measures of extracting information from the global sequence based on the Bayes discriminant algorithm are reviewed. 1) The auto-correlation functions of amino acid indices along the sequence; 2) The quasi-sequence-order approach; 3) the pseudo-amino acid composition; 4) the unified attribute vector in Hilbert space, 5) Zp parameters extracted from the Zp curve. The actual performance of the predictive accuracy is closely related to the degree of similarity between the training and testing sets or to the average degree of pairwise similarity in dataset in a cross-validated study. Many scholars considered that the current higher predictive accuracy still cannot ensure that some available algorithms are effective in practice prediction for the higher pairwise sequence identity of the datasets, but some of them declared that construction of the dataset used for developing software should base on the reality determined by the Mother Nature that some subcellular locations really contain only a minor number of proteins of which some even have a high percentage of sequence similarity. Owing to the complexity of the problem itself, some very sophisticated and special programs are needed for both constructing dataset and improving the prediction. Anyhow finding the target information in mature protein sequence and properly cooperating it with sorting signals in prediction may further improve the overall predictive accuracy and make the prediction into practice.},

	abstract = {Context: Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), a protein secreted by the liver, is the main thyroid hormone (TH) transporter in human serum. TBG deficiency is characterized by reduced serum TH levels, but normal free TH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and absent clinical manifestations. The inherited form of TBG deficiency is usually due to a mutation in the TBG gene located on the X-chromosome. Objective: Of 75 families with X-chromosome linked TBG deficiency identified in our laboratory, no mutations in the TBG gene were found in 4 families. The aim of the study was to identify the mechanism of TBG deficiency in these four families using biochemical and genetic studies. Design: Observational cohort, prospective. Setting: University Research Center. Patients: Four families with inherited TBG deficiency and no mutations in the TBG gene. Intervention: Clinical evaluation, thyroid function tests and targeted re-sequencing of 1Mb of the X-chromosome. Results: Next generation sequencing identified a novel G to A variant 20kb downstream of the TBG gene in all 4 families. In silico analysis predicted that the variant resides within a liver-specific enhancer. In vitro studies confirmed the enhancer activity of a 2.2kb fragment of genomic DNA containing the novel variant and showed that the mutation reduces the activity of this enhancer. The affected subjects share a haplotype of 8Mb surrounding the mutation and the most recent common ancestor among the four families was estimated to be 19.5 generations ago [95\% confidence intervals: 10.4-37]. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of an inherited endocrine disorder caused by a mutation in an enhancer region.},

	abstract = {The mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IgVH) has been found to be a good prognostic indicator for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) because unmutated VH genes are associated with rapid disease progression and shorter survival time. To study the differences in gene expression between the Ig-unmutated and Ig-mutated CLL subtypes, we performed gene expression profiling on 31 CLL cases and investigated the VH gene mutation status by sequencing. The array data showed that the greatest variances between the unmutated (20 cases) and the mutated (11 cases) group were in expressions of ZAP70, RAF1, PAX5, TCF1, CD44, SF1, S100A12, NUP214, DAF, GLVR1, MKK6, AF4, CX3CR1, NAFTC1, and HEX. ZAP70 was significantly more expressed in the Ig-unmutated CLL group, whereas the expression of all the other genes was higher in the Ig-mutated cases. These results corroborate a recent finding, according to which the expression of ZAP70 can predict the VH mutation status and suggest that RAF1, PAX5, and other differentially expressed genes may offer good markers for differentiating unmutated cases from mutated cases and thus serve as prognostic markers.},

	volume = {502},
	abstract = {Animals display a repertoire of different social behaviours. Appropriate behavioural responses depend on sensory input received during social interactions. In mice, social behaviour is driven by pheromones, chemical signals that encode information related to age, sex and physiological state. However, although mice show different social behaviours towards adults, juveniles and neonates, sensory cues that enable specific recognition of juvenile mice are unknown. Here we describe a juvenile pheromone produced by young mice before puberty, termed exocrine-gland secreting peptide 22 (ESP22). ESP22 is secreted from the lacrimal gland and released into tears of 2- to 3-week-old mice. Upon detection, ESP22 activates high-affinity sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ, and downstream limbic neurons in the medial amygdala. Recombinant ESP22, painted on mice, exerts a powerful inhibitory effect on adult male mating behaviour, which is abolished in knockout mice lacking TRPC2, a key signalling component of the vomeronasal organ. Furthermore, knockout of TRPC2 or loss of ESP22 production results in increased sexual behaviour of adult males towards juveniles, and sexual responses towards ESP22-deficient juveniles are suppressed by ESP22 painting. Thus, we describe a pheromone of sexually immature mice that controls an innate social behaviour, a response pathway through the accessory olfactory system and a new role for vomeronasal organ signalling in inhibiting sexual behaviour towards young. These findings provide a molecular framework for understanding how a sensory system can regulate behaviour.},

	abstract = {rECH1, a recently identified rat cDNA (FitzPatrick, D. R., Germain-Lee, E., and Valle, D. (1995) Genomics 27, 457-466) encodes a polypeptide belonging to the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. We modeled the structure of rECH1 based on rat mitochondrial 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1. The model predicts that rECH1p has the hydratase fold in the core domain and two domains for interaction with other subunits. When we incubated 3,5,8,11, 14-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA with purified rECH1p, the spectral data suggested a switching of the double bonds from the Delta3-Delta5 to the Delta2-Delta4 positions. This was confirmed by demonstrating that the product was a valid substrate for 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. These results indicate that rECH1p is Delta3,5-Delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to a synthetic polypeptide derived from the C terminus of rECH1p showed that rECH1p is located in the matrix of both mitochondria and peroxisomes in rat liver. Consistent with these observations, the 36,000-Da rECH1p has a potential N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal as well as a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal type 1. Transport of the protein into the mitochondria with cleavage of the targeting signal results in a mature mitochondrial form with a molecular mass of 32,000 Da; transport to peroxisomes yields a protein of 36,000 Da.},

Important components of the molecular machinery that orchestrates OSN Ca(2+) dynamics have been described, but key details are still missing. Here, we demonstrate a critical physiological role of mitochondrial Ca(2+) mobilization in mouse OSNs. Combining a new mitochondrial Ca(2+) imaging approach with patch-clamp recordings, organelle mobility assays and ultrastructural analyses, our study identifies mitochondria as key determinants of olfactory signaling. We show that mitochondrial Ca(2+) mobilization during sensory stimulation shapes the cytosolic Ca(2+) response profile in OSNs, ensures a broad dynamic response range and maintains sensitivity of the spike generation machinery. When mitochondrial function is impaired, olfactory neurons function as simple stimulus detectors rather than as intensity encoders. Moreover, we describe activity-dependent recruitment of mitochondria to olfactory knobs, a mechanism that provides a context-dependent tool for OSNs to maintain cellular homeostasis and signaling integrity.},

Alignment-based techniques provide additional benefits. In spite of high success rates signal peptide predictors yield false predictions. Simple sequences like polyvaline, for example, are predicted as signal peptides. The general architecture of learning systems makes it difficult to trace the cause of such problems. This kind of false predictions can be recognized or avoided altogether by using sequence comparison techniques. Based on these results we have implemented a public web service, called Signal-BLAST.

	abstract = {Cytidine deaminase, purified to homogeneity from constitutive mutants of Escherichia coli, was found to bind the competitive inhibitors pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside (apparent Ki = 3.6 x 10(-7) M) and 5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside (apparent Ki = 3.5 x 10(-8) M). Enzyme binding resulted in a change of the lambda max of pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside from 303 nm for the free species to 239 nm for the bound species. The value for the bound species was identical with that of an oxygen adduct formed by combination of hydroxide ion with 1,3-dimethyl-2-oxopyrimidinium (239 nm), but lower than that of a sulfur adduct formed by combination of the thiolate anion of N-acetylcysteamine with 1,3-dimethyl-2-oxopyrimidinium (259 nm). The results suggest that pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside is bound by cytidine deaminase as an oxygen adduct, probably the covalent hydrate 3,4-dihydrouridine, rather than intact or as an adduct involving a thiol group of the enzyme. In dilute solution at 25 degrees C, the equilibrium constant for formation of a single diastereomer of 3,4-dihydrouridine from pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside was estimated as approximately 4.7 x 10(-6), from equilibria of dissociation of water, protonation of 1-methylpyrimidin-2-one, and combination of the 1,3-dimethylpyrimidinium cation with the hydroxide ion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	volume = {391},
	abstract = {Almost all secretory proteins have a sequence consisting of 15-30 amino acids at the N-terminus (the so-called N-terminal signal peptide). Signal peptides direct the propeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum and through the secretory pathway. Although the sequences of signal peptides vary greatly, all contain a basic amino acid in the N-terminal region, followed by a hydrophobic core region. With the aim of improving the level of secretion of recombinant proteins in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), we designed several signal peptides based on the signal peptide of silkworm SP1 by introducing the basic amino acid arginine into the N-terminal region and/or the polar amino acid asparagine into the C-terminal region of the silkworm SP1 signal peptide. Human interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and the extracellular domain of human IL-11 receptor alpha1 (IL-11Ralpha1) were fused to wild-type and modified SP1 signal peptides, and the effects that each signal peptide had on secretion were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Introduction of the basic amino acid arginine into the N-terminal region did not result in an increase in secretion of the recombinant proteins. On the other hand, introduction of the polar amino acid asparagine into the C-terminal region enhanced secretion of the recombinant proteins. Therefore, it is suggested that polar amino acids in the C-terminal region of signal peptides are important in the secretion of recombinant proteins in BEVS.},

RESULTS: An expanded database of proteins of known localization and new modules using frequent subsequence-based support vector machines was introduced into PSORTb v.2.0. The program attains a precision of 96\% for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and predictive coverage comparable to other tools for whole proteome analysis.

	title = {{FISH} {Amyloid} - a new method for finding amyloidogenic segments in proteins based on site specific co-occurrence of aminoacids},
	volume = {15},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyloids are proteins capable of forming fibrils whose intramolecular contact sites assume densely packed zipper pattern. Their oligomers can underlie serious diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Recent studies show that short segments of aminoacids can be responsible for amyloidogenic properties of a protein. A few hundreds of such peptides have been experimentally found but experimental testing of all candidates is currently not feasible. Here we propose an original machine learning method for classification of aminoacid sequences, based on discovering a segment with a discriminative pattern of site-specific co-occurrences between sequence elements. The pattern is based on the positions of residues with correlated occurrence over a sliding window of a specified length. The algorithm first recognizes the most relevant training segment in each positive training instance. Then the classification is based on maximal distances between co-occurrence matrix of the relevant segments in positive training sequences and the matrix from negative training segments. The method was applied for studying sequences of aminoacids with regard to their amyloidogenic properties. RESULTS: Our method was first trained on available datasets of hexapeptides with the amyloidogenic classification, using 5 or 6-residue sliding windows. Depending on the choice of training and testing datasets, the area under ROC curve obtained the value up to 0.80 for experimental, and 0.95 for computationally generated (with 3D profile method) datasets. Importantly, the results on 5-residue segments were not significantly worse, although the classification required that algorithm first recognized the most relevant training segments. The dataset of long sequences, such as sup35 prion and a few other amyloid proteins, were applied to test the method and gave encouraging results. Our web tool FISH Amyloid was trained on all available experimental data 4-10 residues long, offers prediction of amyloidogenic segments in protein sequences. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a new original classification method which recognizes co-occurrence patterns in sequences. The method reveals characteristic classification pattern of the data and finds the segments where its scoring is the strongest, also in long training sequences. Applied to the problem of amyloidogenic segments recognition, it showed a good potential for classification problems in bioinformatics.},

Currently, it connects human phenotype and clinical data in various locus-specific databases (LSDBs) with data on genome sequences, evolutionary history, and function from the ENCODE project and other resources in the UCSC Genome Browser. Initially, we focused on a few selected LSDBs covering genes encoding alpha- and beta-globins (HBA, HBB), phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), blood group antigens (various genes), androgen receptor (AR), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), but we plan to include additional loci of clinical importance, ultimately genomewide. We have also imported variant data and associated OMIM links from Swiss-Prot. Users can find interesting mutations in the UCSC Genome Browser (in a new Locus Variants track) and follow links back to the LSDBs for more detailed information. Alternatively, they can start with queries on mutations or phenotypes at an LSDB and then display the results at the Genome Browser to view complementary information such as functional data (e.g., chromatin modifications and protein binding from the ENCODE consortium), evolutionary constraint, regulatory potential, and/or any other tracks they choose. We present several examples illustrating the power of these connections for exploring phenotypes associated with functional elements, and for identifying genomic data that could help to explain clinical phenotypes.},

The paper introduces the selection of the number of clusters based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle for the selection of the number of clusters in gene expression data. The main feature of the new method is the ability to evaluate in a fast way the number of clusters according to the sound MDL principle, without exhaustive evaluations over all possible partitions of the gene set. The estimation method can be used in conjunction with various clustering algorithms. A recent clustering algorithm using principal component analysis, the "gene shaving" (GS) procedure, can be modified to make use of the new MDL estimation method, replacing the Gap statistics originally used in GS algorithm. The resulting clustering algorithm is shown to perform better than GS-Gap and CEM (classification expectation maximization), in the simulations using artificial data. The proposed method is applied to B-cell differentiation data, and the resulting clusters are compared with those found by self-organizing maps (SOM).},

Both strains of mice responded to LPS with a 20- to 30-fold increase in plasma amyloid P component (AP) levels. There were no differences in the response between males and females or between FO and CO treatment groups. The data demonstrated that cultured peritoneal macrophages (M phi) respond to LPS stimulation with increased secretion of AP. In contrast to plasma AP levels, the MO response to LPS stimulation, as measured by production of AP, was influenced by both gender and diet. Although M phi from both male and female mice on the CO diet and male mice on the FO diet responded similarly, those from female mice on the FO diet secreted only 25 to 35\% as much AP as did the other three groups.

Matrix effect heavily influences both qualitative and quantitative analyses, giving rise to suppression or enhancement of the signal. As generally recognised, the predominant cause is the presence of undesired components that co-elute in the chromatographic separation and alter the ionisation process. The interfering species can be components of the sample, compounds released during the pre-treatment/extraction process or reagents added to the mobile phase to improve chromatographic resolution. The different mechanisms proposed in literature to explain the suppression or the enhancement of the signal both in electrospray and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisations are presented and the results observed in the different experimental conditions are compared and discussed. All data together lead to conclude that the chemical properties of the target analyte, the kind of matrix, the matrix to analyte concentration ratio, the extraction process, the chromatographic conditions as well as the kind of the mass spectrometry instrumentation and the ionisation conditions can play a role. Likely all these potential causes act in a synergic way and the final effect observed is hardly due to only one of them. Depending on an unpredictable combination of conditions, signal suppression or enhancement can be observed. The review discusses the matrix effects observed in HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS analysis proposes hypotheses to explain the observed behaviours and proposes methods and strategies to overcome the matrix effects.},

	volume = {1161},
	abstract = {Adenosine deaminase from Aspergillus oryzae resembles mammalian adenosine deaminases in its ability to catalyze the hydrolytic removal of many substituents from C-6, and in the chirality at C-6 of the active isomer of the transition-state-analogue inhibitor 6-hydroxymethyl-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside. The 5'-OH group of adenosine has been found to contribute a factor of 5.10(4) to transition-state stabilization by calf intestinal adenosine deaminase, and crystallographic observations suggest that a zinc-histidine 'bridge' is formed between the 6-OH and the 5'-OH groups of the substrate in the transition state for its deamination. The present paper describes experiments indicating that this bridge is not present during the action of adenosine deaminase from Aspergillus oryzae. We find (1), that the fungal enzyme catalyzes deamination of adenosine and 5'-deoxyadenosine with kcat/Km values that are almost identical; (2), that the Ki value of the transition-state-analogue inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin is much higher for the fungal enzyme (2.7.10(-9) M) than for the mammalian enzyme (2.10(-12) M) and (3), that this difference in binding affinities arises mainly from a difference in rates of enzyme-inhibitor association. Thus, the onset of inhibition was markedly slower for the fungal enzyme (kon = 1.3.10(4) M-1 s-1) than for the calf intestinal enzyme (kon = 2.6.10(6) M-1 s-1). Effects of chelating agents and divalent cations suggest that the fungal enzyme, like other deaminases for adenosine and cytidine, contains essential zinc.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: There is a scarcity of efficient computational methods for predicting protein subcellular localization in eukaryotes. Currently available methods are inadequate for genome-scale predictions with several limitations. Here, we present a new prediction method, pTARGET that can predict proteins targeted to nine different subcellular locations in the eukaryotic animal species. RESULTS: The nine subcellular locations predicted by pTARGET include cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular/secretory, golgi, lysosomes, mitochondria, nucleus, plasma membrane and peroxisomes. Predictions are based on the location-specific protein functional domains and the amino acid compositional differences across different subcellular locations. Overall, this method can predict 68-87\% of the true positives at accuracy rates of 96-99\%. Comparison of the prediction performance against PSORT showed that pTARGET prediction rates are higher by 11-60\% in 6 of the 8 locations tested. Besides, the pTARGET method is robust enough for genome-scale prediction of protein subcellular localizations since, it does not rely on the presence of signal or target peptides. AVAILABILITY: A public web server based on the pTARGET method is accessible at the URL http://bioinformatics.albany.edu/ ptarget.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Nucleosome positioning participates in many cellular activities and plays significant roles in regulating cellular processes. With the avalanche of genome sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is highly desired to develop automated methods for rapidly and effectively identifying nucleosome positioning. Although some computational methods were proposed, most of them were species specific and neglected the intrinsic local structural properties that might play important roles in determining the nucleosome positioning on a DNA sequence. RESULTS: Here a predictor called 'iNuc-PseKNC' was developed for predicting nucleosome positioning in Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster genomes, respectively. In the new predictor, the samples of DNA sequences were formulated by a novel feature-vector called 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition', into which six DNA local structural properties were incorporated. It was observed by the rigorous cross-validation tests on the three stringent benchmark datasets that the overall success rates achieved by iNuc-PseKNC in predicting the nucleosome positioning of the aforementioned three genomes were 86.27\%, 86.90\% and 79.97\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the results obtained by iNuc-PseKNC on various benchmark datasets used by the previous investigators for different genomes also indicated that the current predictor remarkably outperformed its counterparts.

These effects make it an interesting lead for drug discovery. We have combined current structural and biological information to model the structure of hCGRP-beta to be used as a basis for the rational design of novel analogues. Distinct regions of CGRP have been shown to be responsible for the activity of the whole molecule. Thus, the structure of the peptide was modelled in four parts which were finally combined. A random search of conformational space was performed for the fragments CGRP1-8 and CGRP30-37 which have been shown to be central for receptor activation and binding, respectively. Five low-energy hCGRP-beta structures were obtained from modelled fragments by molecular dynamics. The relevance of the approach was verified by comparing the models with NMR structures of CGRP and calcitonin. The models obtained for the N- and C-terminal fragments should enable the design of novel agonists and antagonists of the CGRP receptor, respectively. Models of the whole molecule may be used in the design of peptides with shortened spacers between the receptor-bound regions. The approach described is applicable to several related peptide hormones, like growth hormone-releasing hormone and secretin.},

	abstract = {A defective form of the AIRE protein causes autoimmune destruction of target organs by disturbing the immunological tolerance of patients with a rare monogenic disease, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (APE)-candidiasis (C)-ectodermal dystrophy (ED), APECED. Recently, experiments on knockout mice revealed that AIRE controls autoimmunity by regulating the transcription of peripheral tissue-restricted antigens in thymic medullary epithelial cells. Thus, AIRE provides a unique model for molecular studies of organ-specific autoimmunity. In order to analyze the molecular and cellular consequences of 16 disease-causing mutations in vitro, we studied the subcellular localization, transactivation capacity, homomultimerization, and complex formation of several mutant AIRE polypeptides. Most of the mutations altered the nucleus-cytoplasm distribution of AIRE and disturbed its association with nuclear dots and cytoplasmic filaments. While the PHD zinc fingers were necessary for the transactivation capacity of AIRE, other regions of AIRE also modulated this function. Consequently, most of the mutations decreased transactivation. The HSR domain was responsible for the homomultimerization activity of AIRE; all the missense mutations of the HSR and the SAND domains decreased this activity, but those in other domains did not. The AIRE protein was present in soluble high-molecular-weight complexes. Mutations in the HSR domain and deletion of PHD zinc fingers disturbed the formation of these complexes. In conclusion, we propose an in vitro model in which AIRE transactivates transcription through heteromeric molecular interactions that are regulated by homomultimerization and conditional localization of AIRE in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm.},

Btk belongs to the Tec family of tyrosine kinases. Each member of the family contains five regions and mutations causing XLA have been isolated in all five regions. We have determined the solution structure of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Btk using two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on natural abundance and 15N-labeled protein material. The structure determination is complemented by investigation of backbone dynamics based on 15N NMR relaxation. The Btk SH3 forms a well-defined structure and shows the typical SH3 topology of two short antiparallel beta-sheets packed almost perpendicular to each other in a sandwich-like fold. The N- and C-termini are more flexible as are peptide fragments in the RT and n-Src loops. The studied Btk SH3 fragment adopts two slowly interconverting conformations with a relative concentration ratio of 7:1. The overall fold of the minor form is similar to that of the major form, as judged on the basis of observed NOE connectivities and small chemical shift differences. A tryptophan (W251) ring flip is the favored mechanism for interconversion, although other possibilities cannot be excluded. The side chain of Y223, which becomes autophosphorylated upon activation of Btk, is exposed within the potential SH3 ligand binding site. Finally, we compare the present Btk SH3 structure with other SH3 structures.},

The binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing pH in the neutral range. 3-Chloroacetol sulfate, synthesized as an active-site-specific reagent for triosephosphate isomerase, is used to provide an indication of the pKa of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme. Previously described active-site-specific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters, and their changing state of ionization (accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site) may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pKa of the essential carboxyl group from the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation. Being a strong monoprotic acid, chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pKa of the carboxyl group. Chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier. From the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase, the apparent pKa of the active-site carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.1.},

Our results showed that these modified signal peptides still functioned, as indicated by cytokine secretion.

Although 12 active isoenzymes of this family had already been described, analyses of genomic databases suggested that there still exists another isoenzyme, CA XV. Sequence analyses were performed to identify those species that are likely to have an active form of this enzyme. Eight species had genomic sequences encoding CA XV, in which all the amino acid residues critical for CA activity are present. However, based on the sequence data, it was apparent that CA XV has become a non-processed pseudogene in humans and chimpanzees. RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) confirmed that humans do not express CA XV. In contrast, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization performed in mice showed positive expression in the kidney, brain and testis. A prediction of the mouse CA XV structure was performed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that mouse CA XV is related to CA IV. Therefore both of these enzymes were expressed in COS-7 cells and studied in parallel experiments. The results showed that CA XV shares several properties with CA IV, i.e. it is a glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, and it binds CA inhibitor. The catalytic activity of CA XV is low, and the correct formation of disulphide bridges is important for the activity. Both specific and non-specific chaperones increase the production of active enzyme. The results suggest that CA XV is the first member of the alpha-CA gene family that is expressed in several species, but not in humans and chimpanzees.},

The best prediction tool detected only 63\%. A potential reason for the poor performance is the domain architecture of long signal peptides, whose structural peculiarities are insufficiently considered by current prediction algorithms. To overcome this limitation, we motivate a general domain view of long signal peptides, which becomes detectable when both the overall length and secondary structure of long signal peptides are taken into consideration.

S. cerevisiae transformants containing the resulting expression vectors secreted negligible amounts of either Echis or PAI-1.

	abstract = {Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a secreted glycoprotein found in the extracellular matrices of skeletal tissues. Mutations associated with two human skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, disturb COMP secretion leading to intracellular accumulation of mutant COMP, especially in chondrocytes. Here we show that the manifestation of this secretory defect is dramatically influenced by the signal peptide that targets COMP for secretion. The comparison of wild type and mutant COMP secretion directed by the COMP or BM40 signal peptide in HEK-293 cells and rat chondrosarcoma cells revealed that the BM40 signal peptide substantially enhances secretion of mutant COMP that accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum-like structures when targeted by its own signal peptide. Additionally, we demonstrate that mutant COMP forms mixed pentamers with wild type COMP. Our findings suggest that the secretory defect in pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is not specific for chondrocytes, nor does it require interaction of mutant COMP with other matrix proteins prior to transport from the cell. They also imply a previously unappreciated role for the signal peptide in the regulation of protein secretion beyond targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum.},

	volume = {101},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the utility of single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for mutation screening in the BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene, we investigated 56 X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) families. To obtain genotype/ phenotype correlations, predicted protein aberrations were correlated with the clinical course of the disease. PATIENTS: This study included 56 patients with XLA, with or without a positive family history, who were diagnosed on the basis of their clinical features, low peripheral B-cell count, and low immunoglobulin levels. Ten patients with isolated hypogammaglobulinemia and 50 healthy males served as controls. METHODS: SSCP analysis was performed for the entire BTK gene, including the exon-intron boundaries and the promoter region. Structural implications of the missense mutations were investigated by molecular modeling, and the functional consequences of some mutations also were evaluated by in vitro kinase assays and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: We report the largest series of patients with XLA to date. All but 5 of the 56 index patients with XLA screened with SSCP analysis showed BTK gene abnormalities, and in 2 of the 5 SSCP-negative patients, no BTK protein was found by Western blot analysis. There were 51 mutations, including 37 novel ones, distributed across the entire gene. This report contains the first promoter mutation as well as 14 novel missense mutations with the first ones described for the Tec homology domain and the glycine-rich motif in the SH1 domain. Each index patient had a different mutation, except for four mutations, each in two unrelated individuals. This result supports the strong tendency for private mutations in this disease. No mutations were found in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that molecular genetic testing by SSCP analysis provides an accurate tool for the definitive diagnosis of XLA and the discrimination of borderline cases, such as certain hypogammaglobulinemia or common variable immunodeficiency patients with overlapping clinical features. Genotype/ phenotype correlations are not currently possible, making prediction of the clinical course based on molecular genetic data infeasible.},

	abstract = {A novel computational method for prediction of proteins excreted into urine is presented. The method is based on the identification of a list of distinguishing features between proteins found in the urine of healthy people and proteins deemed not to be urine excretory. These features are used to train a classifier to distinguish the two classes of proteins. When used in conjunction with information of which proteins are differentially expressed in diseased tissues of a specific type versus control tissues, this method can be used to predict potential urine markers for the disease. Here we report the detailed algorithm of this method and an application to identification of urine markers for gastric cancer. The performance of the trained classifier on 163 proteins was experimentally validated using antibody arrays, achieving {\textgreater}80\% true positive rate. By applying the classifier on differentially expressed genes in gastric cancer vs normal gastric tissues, it was found that endothelial lipase (EL) was substantially suppressed in the urine samples of 21 gastric cancer patients versus 21 healthy individuals. Overall, we have demonstrated that our predictor for urine excretory proteins is highly effective and could potentially serve as a powerful tool in searches for disease biomarkers in urine in general.},

	abstract = {The soil of potato fields in The Netherlands harbors bacteria with the ability to metabolize 3-chloroacrylic acid, generated by the degradation of a pesticide (1,3-dichloropropene) that entered the environment in 1946. From examination of rate constants at elevated temperatures, we infer that the half-time at 25 degrees C for spontaneous hydrolytic dechlorination of trans-3-chloroacrylic acid is 10,000 years, several orders of magnitude longer than half-times for spontaneous decomposition of other environmental pollutants such as 1,2-dichloroethane (72 years), paraoxon (13 months), atrazine (5 months), and aziridine (52 h). With thermodynamic parameters for activation similar to those for the spontaneous hydration of fumarate at pH 6.8, this slow reaction proceeds at a constant rate through the pH range between 2 and 12. However, at the active site of the enzyme 3-chloroacrylate dehalogenase (CaaD), isolated from a pseudomonad growing in these soils, hydrolytic dechlorination proceeds with a half-time of 0.18 s. Neither k(cat) nor k(cat)/K(m) is reduced by increasing solvent viscosity with trehalose, implying that the rate of enzymatic dechlorination is controlled by chemical events in catalysis rather than by diffusion-limited substrate binding or product release. CaaD achieves an approximately 10(12)-fold rate enhancement, matching or surpassing the rate enhancements produced by many enzymes that act on more conventional biological substrates. One of those enzymes is 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, with which CaaD seems to share a common evolutionary origin.},

	volume = {45},
	abstract = {Dihydroorotase (DHOase, EC 3.5.2.3) from the extreme thermophile Bacillus caldolyticus has been subcloned, sequenced, expressed, and purified as a monomer. The catalytic properties of this thermophilic DHOase have been compared with another type I enzyme, the DHOase domain from hamster, to investigate how the thermophilic enzyme is adapted to higher temperatures. B. caldolyticus DHOase has higher Vmax and Ks values than hamster DHOase at the same temperature. The thermodynamic parameters for the binding of L-dihydroorotate were determined at 25 degrees C for hamster DHOase (deltaG = -6.9 kcal/mol, deltaH = -11.5 kcal/mol, TdeltaS = -4.6 kcal/mol) and B. caldolyticus DHOase (deltaG = -5.6 kcal/mol, deltaH = -4.2 kcal/mol, TdeltaS = +1.4 kcal/mol). The smaller enthalpy release and positive entropy for thermophilic DHOase are indicative of a weakly interacting Michaelis complex. Hamster DHOase has an enthalpy of activation of 12.3 kcal/mol, similar to the release of enthalpy upon substrate binding, rendering the kcat/Ks value almost temperature independent. B. caldolyticus DHOase shows a decrease in the enthalpy of activation from 12.2 kcal/mol at temperatures from 30 to 50 degrees C to 5.3 kcal/mol for temperatures of 50-70 degrees C. Vibrational energy at higher temperatures may facilitate the transition ES –{\textgreater} ES(double dagger), making kcat/Ks almost temperature independent. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for water attack on L-dihydroorotate, based on experiments at elevated temperature, is 3.2 x 10(-11) s(-1) at 25 degrees C, with deltaH(double dagger) = 24.7 kcal/mol and TdeltaS(double dagger) = -6.9 kcal/mol. Thus, hamster DHOase enhances the rate of substrate hydrolysis by a factor of 1.6 x 10(14), achieving this rate enhancement almost entirely by lowering the enthalpy of activation (delta deltaH(double dagger) = -19.5 kcal/mol). Both the rate enhancement and transition state affinity of hamster DHOase increase steeply with decreasing temperature, consistent with the development of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions in the transition state that were not present in the enzyme-substrate complex in the ground state.},

Nucleotide strand hybridization forms the underlying principle for these methods. For all these techniques, the probes should be unique for analyzed genes. In addition to being unique for the studied genes, the probes should fulfill a large number of criteria to be usable and valid. The criteria include for example, avoidance of self-annealing, suitable melting temperature and nucleotide composition. We developed a method for searching unique and valid oligonucleotides or probes for genes so that there is not even a similar (approximate) occurrence in any other location of the whole genome. By using probe size 25, we analyzed 17 complete genomes representing a wide range of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. More than 92\% of all the genes in the investigated genomes contained valid oligonucleotides. Extensive statistical tests were performed to characterize the properties of unique and valid oligonucleotides. Unique and valid oligonucleotides were relatively evenly distributed in genes except for the beginning and end, which were somewhat overrepresented. The flanking regions in eukaryotes were clearly underrepresented among suitable oligonucleotides. In addition to distributions within genes, the effects on codon and amino acid usage were also studied.},

We analyzed AR for mutations and amplifications in 21 locally recurrent prostate carcinomas treated with orchiectomy, estrogens, or a combination of orchiectomy and estramustine phosphate using fluorescence in situ hybridization, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and DNA sequence analyses. Amplification was observed in 4 of 16 (25\%) and amino acid changing mutations was observed in 7 of 21 (33\%) of the tumors, respectively. Two (50\%) tumors with AR amplification also had missense mutation of the gene. Four of five (80\%) cancers that were treated with a combination of orchiectomy and estramustine phosphate had a mutation clustered at codons 514 to 533 in the N-terminal domain of AR. In functional studies, these mutations did not render AR more sensitive to testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, or beta-estradiol. Tumors treated by orchiectomy had mutations predominantly in the ligand-binding domain. In summary, we found molecular alterations of AR in more than half of the prostate carcinomas that recurred locally. Some tumors developed both aberrations, possibly enhancing the cancer cell to respond efficiently to low levels of androgens. Furthermore, localization of point mutations in AR seems to be influenced by the type of treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main determinant of continuous peripheral nerve block effects–local anesthetic concentration and volume or simply total drug dose–remains unknown. METHODS: We compared two different concentrations and basal rates of ropivacaine–but at equivalent total doses–for continuous posterior lumbar plexus blocks after hip arthroplasty. Preoperatively, a psoas compartment perineural catheter was inserted. Postoperatively, patients were randomly assigned to receive perineural ropivacaine of either 0.1\% (basal 12 ml/h, bolus 4 ml) or 0.4\% (basal 3 ml/h, bolus 1 ml) for at least 48 h. Therefore, both groups received 12 mg of ropivacaine each hour with a possible addition of 4 mg every 30 min via a patient-controlled bolus dose. The primary endpoint was the difference in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the ipsilateral quadriceps the morning after surgery, compared with the preoperative MVIC, expressed as a percentage of the preoperative MVIC. Secondary endpoints included hip adductor and hip flexor MVIC, sensory levels in the femoral nerve distribution, hip range-of-motion, ambulatory ability, pain scores, and ropivacaine consumption. RESULTS: Quadriceps MVIC for patients receiving 0.1\% ropivacaine (n = 26) declined by a mean (SE) of 64.1\% (6.4) versus 68.0\% (5.4) for patients receiving 0.4\% ropivacaine (n = 24) between the preoperative period and the day after surgery (95\% CI for group difference: -8.0-14.4\%; P = 0.70). Similarly, the groups were found to be equivalent with respect to secondary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: For continuous posterior lumbar plexus blocks, local anesthetic concentration and volume do not influence nerve block characteristics, suggesting that local anesthetic dose (mass) is the primary determinant of perineural infusion effects.},

	abstract = {As a first step toward understanding the topology of the signal peptide with respect to the membrane during the protein export process, we have examined the constraints on the length of the cleavage region needed to achieve signal peptidase recognition and cleavage. Using the signal peptide of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, a series of cleavage region mutants has been constructed. Variations in length were brought about by replacing the wild type cleavage region of the signal peptide with polymers of increasingly more residues. In each case, alanine residues are used exclusively in the -1 and -3 positions to provide only one viable cleavage site. Glutamine residues are used in all other positions in order to vary the length from 3 to 13 total residues. Analysis of these mutants revealed that cleavage regions ranging from 3 to 9 residues are completely and efficiently processed. The extent of processing drops substantially thereafter, with no processing observed for signal peptides with 13-residue long cleavage regions. A second mutant with a 13-residue long cleavage region was designed and analyzed to ensure that the lack of processing reflected a cleavage problem and not a translocation defect. The results are consistent with the notion that the signal peptidase active site is in close proximity to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane and that interaction of the cleavage region with the signal peptidase probably depends on, and is constrained by, other interactions involving the signal peptide.},

SGA identifies patient groups with abnormal nutritional parameters, but may fail to identify patients with malnutrition as identified by other techniques, such as total body nitrogen. We sought to compare SGA with a composite nutritional score. METHODS: HD patients were assessed by SGA, anthropometry, 3-day food diary, serum albumin, Kt/V urea, and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). A composite nutritional score was derived from SGA, body mass index, percent of reference weight, triceps skinfold, midarm muscle circumference, and serum albumin. RESULTS: In 72 HD patients an abnormal SGA identified a patient group with reduced midarm circumference, midarm muscle circumference and serum creatinine and an increased composite nutritional score. However, overlap of nutritional scores was considerable between the normal and abnormal SGA groups, suggesting that SGA misclassified a large number of subjects. Serum albumin correlated with C-reactive protein (r = -0.473, P {\textless}.0001), not nutritional status. The composite nutritional score correlated with all of its components except for serum albumin. CONCLUSIONS: SGA may not reliably identify hemodialysis patients with abnormal nutrition. Serum albumin is related to inflammation and not to nutrition status.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {The immunogenicity and safety of a chromatographically purified rabies vaccine (CPRV) was evaluated using US veterinary medical students. In the first study, 242 healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, modified double-blind, multicenter trial and received five doses of either CPRV or human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) by intramuscular injection on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 concurrently with human rabies immunoglobulin in a simulated post-exposure prophylaxis regimen. Post-immunization titers in the CPRV and HDCV groups reached 0.5 IU/ml (the WHO-recommended minimally acceptable titer) or greater in all subjects in both vaccine groups by day 14 and remained above that level through day 90. In the second study, 438 healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial and assigned to receive five doses from one of three lots of CPRV by intramuscular injection on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 in a simulated post-exposure prophylaxis regimen to evaluate lot consistency. Post-immunization titers rapidly increased to over 0.5 IU/ml by day 14 for all subjects and remained above that level through day 42 when the study was terminated. The three lots were considered equivalent. The percentage of subjects with at least one local reaction during the five-dose regimen was slightly lower in the CPRV group than in the HDCV group (P=0.06). The most frequently reported local reaction for all doses of vaccine was pain at the injection site. Headache, myalgia, and malaise were the most frequently reported systemic events. The percentage of subjects with at least one systemic event was significantly lower for CPRV (P=0.0084). No vaccine-related serious adverse reaction was reported in these studies. The results of these studies indicate that CPRV administered intramuscularly to healthy adults is immunogenic and is associated with fewer local and systemic reactions than HDCV.},

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {Positions of equilibria of highly unfavorable addition reactions, whose products are present at concentrations below the limits of detection, can be determined from equilibria of combination of anionic nucleophiles with quaternized enamines. Applied to the newly prepared 1-methylpurinium ribonucleoside cation, this method yields approximate equilibrium constants of 2 X 10(-9) M-1 for addition of water and 4 X 10(-5) M-1 for addition of N-acetylcysteine to neutral purine ribonucleoside, in dilute aqueous solution. Positions of 13C magnetic resonances and UV absorption maxima of the above complexes and comparison with those of adenosine deaminase complexes strongly suggest that purine ribonucleoside is bound by adenosine deaminase as the 1,6 covalent hydrate, not as a covalently bonded complex formed by addition of a thiol group at the active site. The favorable position of equilibrium of the hydration reaction on the enzyme, together with its extremely unfavorable position in free solution, indicates that the effective activity of substrate water at the active site is in the neighborhood of 10(10) M. The Ki value of the active diastereomer of 6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside is estimated as 1.6 X 10(-13) M, more than 8 orders of magnitude lower than the apparent dissociation constants of enzyme complexes with the substrate adenosine or the product inosine. The enzyme's remarkable affinity for this hydrated species, which is vanishingly rare in free solution, seems understandable in terms of the hydrate's close resemblance to a hydrated intermediate approaching the transition state in direct water attack on adenosine.},

	abstract = {The lack of a conserved tyrosine autophosphorylation site is a unique feature of the C-terminal Src-kinase, Csk, although this protein tyrosine kinase can be autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vitro and in bacteria. Here we show that human Csk is tyrosine phosphorylated in HeLa cells treated with sodium pervanadate. Phosphorylation in vivo occurs mainly at Tyr-184 and in vitro mainly at Tyr-304. A Y304F mutation strongly decreased Csk phosphorylation in vitro, and a Y184F mutation abolished tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. A catalytically inactive form of Csk was also phosphorylated on Tyr-184 in vivo, suggesting that this is not a site of autophosphorylation. The kinase activity of the Y184F protein was not changed, while the Y304F protein showed one-third of wild-type activity. Three-dimensional modelling of the Csk kinase domain indicated that the Y304F mutation abolishes one of two conserved hydrogen bonds between the upper and the lower lobes in the open conformation of the kinase domain. Phosphopeptide binding studies suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr-184 creates a binding site for low-molecular-mass proteins. Cellular Csk was associated with several phosphoproteins, some of which were interacting with the Csk SH2 domain. Taken together these results indicate that Csk can be phosphorylated in vivo at Tyr-184 by an as yet unknown tyrosine kinase, and that autophosphorylation of Tyr-304 occurs only at abnormally high Csk concentrations in vitro. Furthermore, Tyr-304 is required for the maintenance of the structure of the Csk kinase domain.},

Though CD4+ specific T cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, infiltrating plasma cells and autoantibodies are known to have an effect on the coeliac disease, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the tissue injury remain to be elucidated. Our aim was to find novel gene transcripts, which might have a role in coeliac disease pathogenesis. The gene expression in duodenal biopsy samples from untreated coeliac patients (n=4), patients on gluten-free diet (n=4) and healthy controls (n=4) was studied by cDNA microarray analysis. The method allows monitoring of the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. Compared to healthy controls, the expression of 156 and 60 genes was changed in untreated and treated coeliac disease, respectively. Between treated and untreated coeliac disease, 98 genes had altered expression. Of the 5184 genes or expressed sequence tags, altogether 263 were affected. Many of these genes are directly or indirectly connected to T-cell activation, B-cell maturation or epithelial cell differentiation. By the microarray method, numerous genes were found to evince altered mRNA expression in coeliac disease. The method holds promise in exploring the pathogenetic mechanisms in the small bowel and may reveal new target genes for the therapy of coeliac disease.},

	abstract = {An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1\% to 3.9\% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0\% to 7.7\%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {Nebularine undergoes hydration at the active site of adenosine deaminase, in a reaction analogous to a partial reaction in the displacement of ammonia from adenosine by water, to generate an inhibitory complex that captures much of the binding affinity expected of an ideal transition-state analogue. Enzyme affinities of several compounds related to nebularine 1,6-hydrate, and to its stable analog 2'-deoxycoformycin, were compared in an effort to identify the structural origins of strong binding. Binding of the stable transition-state analog inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin was rendered 9.8 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of substituent ribose, 9.7 kcal/mol less favorable by inversion of the 8-hydroxyl substituent of the diazepine ring, and 10.0 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of atoms 4-6 of the diazepine ring. Binding of the unstable transition-state analog nebularine hydrate was rendered at least 9.9 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of the 6-hydroxyl group and 10.2 kcal/mol less favorable by removal of atoms 1-3 of the pyrimidine ring. In each case, the enzyme exhibited only modest affinity (Kd greater than or equal to 10(-2) M) for the "missing piece", indicating that incorporation of 2 binding determinants within a single molecule permits an additional 7-12 kcal/mol of intrinsic binding energy to be manifested as observed binding energy. These results are consistent with earlier indications that adenosine deaminase may use 10.5 kcal/mol of the intrinsic free energy of binding of the two substrates to place them in positions appropriate for reaction at the active site, overcoming the unfavorable entropy change of -35 eu for the equilibrium of 1,6-hydration of purine ribonucleoside and reducing the equilibrium constant for attainment of the transition state in deamination of adenosine. Thus, adenosine deaminase may achieve up to 8 orders of magnitude of its catalytic power by converting the nonenzymatic, bimolecular, hydration reaction to a monomolecular reaction at its active site. Several new 6-substituted 1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleosides, prepared by photoaddition of formate and by low-temperature addition of organolithium reagents to a derivative of purine ribonucleoside, exhibited Ki values of 9-1400 microM against adenosine deaminase, in accord with the active site's considerable tolerance of bulky leaving groups in substrates. Inhibition by one diastereomer of 6-carboxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside was found to be time-dependent, progressing from a weakly bound to a more strongly bound complex.},

	abstract = {Adenosine deaminase was found to bind 6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside (II), formed by reversible addition of water to purine ribonucleoside (I) in a reaction analogous to formation of a tetrahedral intermediate in substrate deamination, with an apparent Ki value of 3 x 10(-13) M at 20 degrees C. 1,6-Dihydropurine ribonucleoside (IV), synthesized by photolysis of purine ribonucleoside in the presence of NaBH4, exhibited a Ki value of 5.4 x 10-6 M. After correction for differences between the relative free energies of solvation of II and IV, the 6-hydroxyl group of II was estimated to contribute more than 16 kcal to the free energy of binding, approaching the enthalapy of formation of a single hydrogen bond to charged group in the vapor phase. The relatively weak binding of IV and of substrate water suggests that entropic effects, arising from the cooperative action of binding determinants contained within these separate molecules, contribute more than 10 kcal/mol to the free energy of binding of II in which these binding determinants are contained within a single molecule. In free solution, the entropy of reversible hydration of I was evaluated by measuring the temperature dependence of equilibria of protonation of I and of pseudobase formation from I-methylpurinium ribonucleoside as -35 eu, comparable with the entropy of activation for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of adenosine. In the active site of adenosine deaminase, this thermodynamic obstacle is evidently climbed spontaneously as a result of attractive interactions between the active site and the critical hydroxyl group at the 6-position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Synovial cells were cultured with T-614 in the presence or absence of various cytokines. After incubation, the costimulatory molecule expression on synovial cells and cytokine production in culture supernatants were analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescence method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. We also examined the effect of T-614 on the function of synovial cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The costimulatory molecules including CD54, CD58, and CD106 were constitutionally expressed on the surface of synovial cells. However, neither CD80 nor CD86 nor CD102 was found on the surface, and these costimulatory molecules could not be induced by any cytokines. T-614 itself did not affect the costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production of unstimulated synovial cells. The stimulation of synovial cells with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-1beta, or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate enhanced the expression of costimulatory molecules and the proinflammatory cytokine production of these cells. Both the up-regulated expression of these costimulatory molecules and the enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly inhibited by T-614. Autologous T cell proliferation in response to purified protein derivative by IFN-gamma-treated synovial cells was significantly suppressed by T-614. T-614 has considerable immunosuppressive effects on synovial cells by inhibiting the costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production of these cells and the antigen-specific T cell proliferation mediated by the synovial cells.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The CD4 T cell response to the tumor antigen Midkine was unknown. RESULTS: Most of the T cell response to Midkine relies on T cell epitopes contained in its signal peptide. CONCLUSION: The signal peptide of Midkine is accessible to HLA class II pathway for CD4 T cell presentation. SIGNIFICANCE: It is a new function for signal peptides to contribute to tumor-specific CD4 T cell response. Because of the key role of CD4 T cell response in immunity to tumors, we investigated the CD4(+) T cell response to the recently identified tumor antigen Midkine (MDK). By weekly stimulations of T lymphocytes harvested from seven HLA-DR-typed healthy donors, we derived CD4(+) T cell lines specific for eight MDK peptides. Most of the T cell lines reacted with the peptides 9-23 and 14-28, located in and overlapping the MDK signal peptide, respectively. Accordingly, the MDK signal peptide appeared to be rich in good binders to common HLA-DR molecules. The peptide 9-23-specific T cell lines were specifically stimulated by autologous dendritic cells loaded with lysates of MDK-transfected cells or with lysates of tumor cells naturally expressing the MDK protein. One T cell line was stimulated by HLA-compatible MDK-transfected tumor cells. By contrast, the peptide 14-28-specific T cell lines were not stimulated in any of these conditions. Our data demonstrate that CD4(+) T cell epitopes present in the signal peptide can be accessible to recognition by CD4(+) T cells and may therefore contribute to tumor immunity, whereas a peptide overlapping the junction between the signal peptide and the mature protein is not.},

	title = {Spectrum of disease-causing mutations in protein secondary structures},
	volume = {7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most genetic disorders are linked to missense mutations as even minor changes in the size or properties of an amino acid can alter or prevent the function of the protein. Further, the effect of a mutation is also dependent on the sequence and structure context of the alteration. RESULTS: We investigated the spectrum of disease-causing missense mutations in secondary structure elements in proteins with numerous known mutations and for which an experimentally defined three-dimensional structure is available. We obtained a comprehensive map of the differences in mutation frequencies, location and contact energies, and the changes in residue volume and charge - both in the mutated (original) amino acids and in the mutant amino acids in the different secondary structure types. We collected information for 44 different proteins involved in a large number of diseases. The studied proteins contained a total of 2413 mutations of which 1935 (80\%) appeared in secondary structures. Differences in mutation patterns between secondary structures and whole proteins were generally not statistically significant whereas within the secondary structural elements numerous highly significant features were observed. CONCLUSION: Numerous trends in mutated and mutant amino acids are apparent. Among the original residues, arginine clearly has the highest relative mutability. The overall relative mutability among mutant residues is highest for cysteine and tryptophan. The mutability values are higher for mutated residues than for mutant residues. Arginine and glycine are among the most mutated residues in all secondary structures whereas the other amino acids have large variations in mutability between structure types. Statistical analysis was used to reveal trends in different secondary structural elements, residue types as well as for the charge and volume changes.},

Over the last few decades we have predicted, with homology modelling methods, the structures for numerous proteins. In this study we assess the structural quality and validity of the biological and medical interpretations and predictions made based on the models. All the models had correct scaffolding and were ranked at least as correct or good by numerical evaluators even though the sequence identity with the template was as low as 8\%. The biological explanations made based on models were well in line with experimental structures and other experimental studies. Retrospective analysis of homology models indicates the power of protein modelling when made carefully from sequence alignment to model building and refinement. Modelling can be applied to studying and predicting different kinds of biological phenomena and according to our results it can be done so with success.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway has an established role in promoting malignant growth and disease progression in human cancers. Therefore identification of transcriptional targets mediating the oncogenic effects of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway would be highly relevant. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is a recently characterized human oncoprotein. CIP2A promotes malignant cell growth and is over expressed at high frequency (40-80\%) in most of the human cancer types. However, the mechanisms inducing its expression in cancer still remain largely unexplored. Here we present systematic analysis of contribution of potential gene regulatory mechanisms for high CIP2A expression in cancer. Our data shows that evolutionary conserved CpG islands at the proximal CIP2A promoter are not methylated both in normal and cancer cells. Furthermore, sequencing of the active CIP2A promoter region from altogether seven normal and malignant cell types did not reveal any sequence alterations that would increase CIP2A expression specifically in cancer cells. However, treatment of cancer cells with various signaling pathway inhibitors revealed that CIP2A mRNA expression was sensitive to inhibition of EGFR activity as well as inhibition or activation of MEK-ERK pathway. Moreover, MEK1/2-specific siRNAs decreased CIP2A protein expression. Series of CIP2A promoter-luciferase constructs were created to identify proximal -27 to -107 promoter region responsible for MEK-dependent stimulation of CIP2A expression. Additional mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed ETS1 as the transcription factor mediating stimulation of CIP2A expression through EGFR-MEK pathway. Thus, ETS1 is probably mediating high CIP2A expression in human cancers with increased EGFR-MEK1/2-ERK pathway activity. These results also suggest that in addition to its established role in invasion and angiogenesis, ETS1 may support malignant cellular growth via regulation of CIP2A expression and protein phosphatase 2A inhibition.},

The unfolding transition of the three protein domains in the acidic pH region can be described as a reversible two-state process. For all three SH3 domains maximum stability was observed in the pH region 4.5 {\textless} pH {\textless} 7.0 where these domains unfold at temperatures of 353K (Btk), 342K (Itk), and 344K (Tec). At these temperatures an enthalpy change of 196 kJ/mol, 178 kJ/mol, and 169 kJ/mol was measured for Btk-, Itk-, and Tec-SH3 domains, respectively. The determined changes in heat capacity between the native and the denatured state are in an usual range expected for small proteins. Our analysis revealed that all SH3 domains studied are only weakly stabilized and have free energies of unfolding which do not exceed 12-16 kJ/mol but show quite high melting temperatures. Comparing unfolding free energies measured for eukaryotic SH3 domains with those of the topologically identical Sso7d protein from the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus, the increased melting temperature of the thermostable protein is due to a broadening as well as a significant lifting of its stability curve. However, at their physiological temperatures, 310K for mesophilic SH3 domains and 350K for Sso7d, eukaryotic SH3 domains and Sso7d show very similar stabilities.},

	abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR)-interacting protein 3 (ARIP3/PIASxalpha) is a coregulator capable of modulating transcriptional activity of various steroid receptors. We have characterized functional regions of ARIP3 and studied its interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1). We find that the potential zinc-binding domain is critical for ARIP3 to function as a coactivator; the deletion of amino acids 347-418 or the mutation of the conserved cysteines 385 and 388 to serines converts ARIP3 to a transcriptional repressor from AR-dependent minimal promoters and abolishes its ability to activate GR. By contrast, mutations in the two LXXLL motifs of ARIP3 have relatively minor effects on its ability to regulate AR or GR function. ARIP3 is able to interact with different regions of GRIP1, but the strongest interaction is detected with the C-terminal region (amino acids 1122-1462) of GRIP1. The interaction of ARIP3 with the latter GRIP1 domain or full-length GRIP1 and the ability of ARIP3 to cooperate with GRIP1 in the regulation of AR- or GR-dependent transcription are dependent on the ARIP3 zinc-binding region. We also find a strong synergism between GRIP1 and two other PIAS family members, Miz1 and PIAS1. Taken together, our results suggest that PIAS proteins and GRIP1 interact functionally in transcriptional regulation.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and other volatile strong acids, used as modifiers in reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, cause signal suppression for basic compounds when analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Evidence is presented that signal suppression is caused by strong ion pairing between the TFA anion and the protonated sample cation of basic sample molecules. The ion-pairing process "masks" the protonated sample cations from the ESI-MS electric fields by rendering them "neutral. " Weakly basic molecules are not suppressed by this process. The TFA signal suppression effect is independent from the well-known spray problem that electrospray has with highly aqueous solutions that contain TFA. This previously reported spray problem is caused by the high conductivity and surface tension of aqueous TFA solutions. A practical method to enhance the signal for most basic analytes in the presence of signal-suppressing volatile strong acids has been developed. The method employs postcolumn addition of a solution of 75\% propionic acid and 25\% isopropanol in a ratio 1:2 to the column flow. Signal enhancement is typically 10-50 times for peptides and other small basic molecules. Thus, peptide maps that use ESI-MS for detection can be performed at lower levels, with conventional columns, without the need to use capillary chromatography or reduced mass spectral resolution to achieve satisfactory sensitivity. The method may be used with similar results for heptafluorobutyric acid and hydrochloric acid. A mechanism for TFA signal suppression and signal enhancement by the foregoing method, is proposed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inherited factors predisposing individuals to breast and ovarian cancer are largely unidentified in a majority of families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). We aimed to identify germline copy number variations (CNVs) contributing to HBOC susceptibility in the Finnish population. METHODS: A cohort of 84 HBOC individuals (negative for BRCA1/2-founder mutations and pre-screened for the most common breast cancer genes) and 36 healthy controls were analysed with a genome-wide SNP array. CNV-affecting genes were further studied by Gene Ontology term enrichment, pathway analyses, and database searches to reveal genes with potential for breast and ovarian cancer predisposition. CNVs that were considered to be important were validated and genotyped in 20 additional HBOC individuals (6 CNVs) and in additional healthy controls (5 CNVs) by qPCR. RESULTS: An intronic deletion in the EPHA3 receptor tyrosine kinase was enriched in HBOC individuals (12 of 101, 11.9\%) compared with controls (27 of 432, 6.3\%) (OR = 1.96; P = 0.055). EPHA3 was identified in several enriched molecular functions including receptor activity. Both a novel intronic deletion in the CSMD1 tumor suppressor gene and a homozygous intergenic deletion at 5q15 were identified in 1 of 101 (1.0\%) HBOC individuals but were very rare (1 of 436, 0.2\% and 1 of 899, 0.1\%, respectively) in healthy controls suggesting that these variants confer disease susceptibility. CONCLUSION: This study reveals new information regarding the germline CNVs that likely contribute to HBOC susceptibility in Finland.

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Two major high-penetrance breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are responsible for approximately 20\% of hereditary breast cancer (HBC) cases in Finland. Additionally, rare mutations in several other genes that interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of HBC. Still, a majority of HBC cases remain unexplained which is challenging for genetic counseling. We aimed to analyze additional mutations in HBC-associated genes and to define the sensitivity of our current BRCA1/2 mutation analysis protocol used in genetic counseling. METHODS: Eighty-two well-characterized, high-risk hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals, were screened for germline alterations in seven breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, BRIP1, RAD50, and CDH1. BRCA1/2 were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and direct sequencing. CHEK2 was analyzed by the high resolution melt (HRM) method and PALB2, RAD50, BRIP1 and CDH1 were analyzed by direct sequencing. Carrier frequencies between 82 (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals and 384 healthy Finnish population controls were compared by using Fisher's exact test. In silico prediction for novel missense variants effects was carried out by using Pathogenic-Or-Not -Pipeline (PON-P). RESULTS: Three previously reported breast cancer-associated variants, BRCA1 c.5095C {\textgreater} T, CHEK2 c.470T {\textgreater} C, and CHEK2 c.1100delC, were observed in eleven (13.4\%) individuals. Ten of these individuals (12.2\%) had CHEK2 variants, c.470T {\textgreater} C and/or c.1100delC. Fourteen novel sequence alterations and nine individuals with more than one non-synonymous variant were identified. One of the novel variants, BRCA2 c.72A {\textgreater} T (Leu24Phe) was predicted to be likely pathogenic in silico. No large genomic rearrangements were detected in BRCA1/2 by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, mutations in previously known breast cancer susceptibility genes can explain 13.4\% of the analyzed high-risk BRCA1/2-negative HBOC individuals. CHEK2 mutations, c.470T {\textgreater} C and c.1100delC, make a considerable contribution (12.2\%) to these high-risk individuals but further segregation analysis is needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these mutations before applying them in clinical use. Additionally, we identified novel variants that warrant additional studies. Our current genetic testing protocol for 28 Finnish BRCA1/2-founder mutations and protein truncation test (PTT) of the largest exons is sensitive enough for clinical use as a primary screening tool.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the proficiency of phosphatases as catalysts, the rate of the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of simple phosphate monoester dianions was estimated by extrapolating rates measured over a range of high temperatures. The rate of spontaneous hydrolysis of phenyl phosphate dianion indicates that a linear free energy relationship reported earlier is reliable for leaving groups whose conjugate acids have pKa values up to at least 10. Using Teflon reaction vessels, it proved possible to follow the hydrolysis of methyl phosphate and 3-(4-carboxy)-2,2-dimethylpropyl phosphate in strong alkali. Even in 1 M KOH, the reaction was found to be specific acid catalyzed. These results establish an upper limit for dianion reactivity, which had been overestimated earlier as a result of the leaching by alkali of silicic acid from quartz reaction vessels. The present findings indicate that the half-time for attack by water on alkyl phosphate dianions is 1.1 x 10(12) years (k = 2 x 10(-20) s) at 25 degrees C and that phosphatases involved in cell signaling and regulation produce the largest rate enhancements that have been identified thus far.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: PHYSEAN predicts protein classes with highly variable sequences on the basis of their physical, chemical and biological characteristics such as diverse hydrophobicity, structural propensity and steric properties. These characteristics, calculated from multiple positions in a sequence, may be conserved even between sequences that fail to produce alignments at any acceptable level of statistical significance. PHYSEAN complements methods that require sequence alignments (BLAST, FASTA, dynamic programming) by adding less residue- and position-specific physicochemical information on the protein or the domain. RESULTS: We predict proteins or their domains like signal peptides using physical, chemical, geometric, and biological properties of the 20 amino acids. This comprehensive set of properties may cover the diagnostic functional and structural aspects of a domain or a protein class. We automatically select and weight a subset of properties so as to discriminate between, e.g., signal peptides and amino-termini of cytosolic proteins with the lowest number of incorrect predictions. This optimal selection of properties and their weights significantly decreases the number of incorrect predictions as compared to any single property or any combination of unweighted properties. Weights have been optimized by high-performance linear programming models that systematically find the optimal solution from among an astronomic number of property/weight combinations. PHYSEAN's performance is demonstrated by highly accurate predictions of signal peptides (the vehicles for protein transport across membranes) and their cleavage sites. The results indicate reliable predictions are possible even in the lack of sequence conservation using an automated physical and chemical analysis of proteins.},

The major results are: (1) the full E-PPase sequence aligns within residues 28-225 of Y1-PPase, raising the possibility that the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of Y1-PPase may not be essential for activity, and (2) that whereas the overall identity between the two sequences is only modest (22-27\% depending on the choice of alignment parameters), of some 17 putative active site residues, 14-16 are identical between Y-PPase and E-PPase.

The roles of a number of residues were assessed by characterization of cross-reactivity mutants obtained from a phage display library. The cross-reactivity data and the results observed for mutants are explained by the structural model, in which the estradiol D-ring inserts deeply into the binding site and interacts with the antibody through at least one specific hydrogen bond. The binding data strongly suggest that this hydrogen bond connects the estradiol 17-hydroxyl group with the side chain of Gln H35.

Genetic defects affecting CD40 cause a rare form of hyper-immunoglobulin M (IgM) syndrome, a disorder characterized by low or absent serum IgG and IgA, associated with recurrent infections. We previously reported on a few patients with homozygous CD40 mutations resulting in lack or severe reduction of CD40 cell surface expression. Here we characterize the 3 CD40 mutants due to missense mutations or small in-frame deletions, and show that the mutated proteins are synthesized but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), likely due to protein misfolding. Interestingly, the intracellular behavior and fate differ significantly among the mutants: progressive accumulation of the P2 mutant causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and the activation of an unfolded protein response; the mutant P4 is rather efficiently disposed by the ER-associated degradation pathway, while the P5 mutant partially negotiates transport to the plasma membrane, and is competent for CD40L binding. Interestingly, this latter mutant activates downstream signaling elements when overexpressed in transfected cells. These results give new important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HIGM disease, and suggest that CD40 deficiency can also be regarded as an ER-storage disease.},

To analyse the protein structure and consequences of ICF-causing mutations, we modelled the structure of the DNMT3B methyltransferase domain based on Haemophilus haemolyticus protein in complex with the cofactor AdoMet and the target DNA sequence. The structural model has a two-subdomain fold where the DNA-binding region is situated between the subdomains on a surface cleft having positive electrostatic potential. The smaller subdomains of the methyltransferases differ in length and sequences and therefore only the target recognition domain loop was modelled to show the location of an ICF-causing mutation. Based on the model, the DNMT3B recognizes the GC sequence and flips the cytosine from the double-stranded DNA to the catalytic pocket. The amino acids in the cofactor and target cytosine binding sites and also the electrostatic properties of the binding pockets are conserved. In addition, a registry of all known ICF-causing mutations, DNMT3Bbase, was constructed. The structural principles of the pathogenic mutations based on the modelled structure and the analysis of chi angle rotation changes of mutated side chains are discussed.},

The novel cDNA technology has opened the avenue to large-scale gene expression analysis. Our aim was to perform cDNA microarray analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed cDNA microarray analysis using the Clontech hematology filter (containing 406 genes) on 15 patients to study gene expression profiling in AML. As reference, we used whole bone marrow from 5 healthy donors. RESULTS: Our results revealed 50 differentially expressed genes in at least 3 out of 15 patients. Twenty-two genes were upregulated (ratio {\textgreater} or =4), whereas 28 genes were downregulated (ratio {\textless} or =0.25). All but one of the 13 genes tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed the same expression profiles. Among the overexpressed genes, several were those earlier associated with chromosomal translocations and gene fusions. These genes were FGFR1, MYC, NPM1, DEC, and BCL2. The expression of two upregulated genes, HOXA4 and CSF1R, was significantly higher in patients with a white blood cell count higher than 30 x 10(9)/L cells. In patients whose white blood cell count was higher than 100 x 10(9)/L cells, both CLC and GRN were significantly underexpressed, whereas HOXA4 and DAPK1 were overexpressed. FGFR1 and CAMLG were more frequently significantly overexpressed in patients with CD56 immunophenoytpe.

Proteins are typically directed to compartments by short peptide sequences that act as targeting signals. Translocation to the proper compartment allows a protein to form the necessary interactions with its partners and take part in biological networks such as signalling and metabolic pathways. If a protein is not transported to the correct intracellular compartment either the reaction performed or information carried by the protein does not reach the proper site, causing either inactivation of central reactions or misregulation of signalling cascades, or the mislocalized active protein has harmful effects by acting in the wrong place. RESULTS: Numerous methods have been developed to predict protein subcellular localization with quite high accuracy. We applied bioinformatics methods to investigate the effects of known disease-related mutations on protein targeting and localization by analyzing over 22,000 missense mutations in more than 1,500 proteins with two complementary prediction approaches. Several hundred putative localization affecting mutations were identified and investigated statistically. CONCLUSION: Although alterations to localization signals are rare, these effects should be taken into account when analyzing the consequences of disease-related mutations.},

Pathogenic mutations in the RAG1/2 genes result in various forms of primary immunodeficiency, ranging from T(-)B(-) severe combined immune deficiency to delayed-onset disease with granuloma formation, autoimmunity, or both. It is not clear what contributes to such heterogeneity of phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the molecular basis for phenotypic diversity presented in patients with various RAG1 mutations. METHODS: We have developed a flow cytometry-based assay that allows analysis of RAG recombination activity based on green fluorescent protein expression and have assessed the induction of the Ighc locus rearrangements in mouse Rag1(-/-) pro-B cells reconstituted with wild-type or mutant human RAG1 (hRAG1) using deep sequencing technology. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate correlation between defective recombination activity of hRAG1 mutant proteins and severity of the clinical and immunologic phenotype and provide insights on the molecular mechanisms accounting for such phenotypic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Using a sensitive assay to measure the RAG1 activity level of 79 mutations in a physiologic setting, we demonstrate correlation between recombination activity of RAG1 mutants and the severity of clinical presentation and show that RAG1 mutants can induce specific abnormalities of the VDJ recombination process.},

Recent analyses of human and mouse databases provided evidence that human and mouse genomes contain genes for still another novel CA isozyme hereby named CA XIII. In the present study, we modeled the structure of human CA XIII. This model revealed a globular molecule with high structural similarity to cytosolic isozymes, CA I, II, and III. Recombinant mouse CA XIII showed catalytic activity similar to those of mitochondrial CA V and cytosolic CA I, with k(cat)/K(m) of 4.3 x 10(7) m(-1) s(-1), and k(cat) of 8.3 x 10(4) s(-1). It is very susceptible to inhibition by sulfonamide and anionic inhibitors, with inhibition constants of 17 nm for acetazolamide, a clinically used sulfonamide, and of 0.25 microm, for cyanate, respectively. Using panels of cDNAs we evaluated human and mouse CA13 gene expression in a number of different tissues. In human tissues, positive signals were identified in the thymus, small intestine, spleen, prostate, ovary, colon, and testis. In mouse, positive tissues included the spleen, lung, kidney, heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. We also investigated the cellular and subcellular localization of CA XIII in human and mouse tissues using an antibody raised against a polypeptide of 14 amino acids common for both human and mouse orthologues. Immunohistochemical staining showed a unique and widespread distribution pattern for CA XIII compared with the other cytosolic CA isozymes. In conclusion, the predicted amino acid sequence, structural model, distribution, and activity data suggest that CA XIII represents a novel enzyme, which may play important physiological roles in several organs.},

	title = {Assessing protein similarity with {Gene} {Ontology} and its use in subnuclear localization prediction},
	volume = {7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accomplishment of the various genome sequencing projects resulted in accumulation of massive amount of gene sequence information. This calls for a large-scale computational method for predicting protein localization from sequence. The protein localization can provide valuable information about its molecular function, as well as the biological pathway in which it participates. The prediction of localization of a protein at subnuclear level is a challenging task. In our previous work we proposed an SVM-based system using protein sequence information for this prediction task. In this work, we assess protein similarity with Gene Ontology (GO) and then improve the performance of the system by adding a module of nearest neighbor classifier using a similarity measure derived from the GO annotation terms for protein sequences. RESULTS: The performance of the new system proposed here was compared with our previous system using a set of proteins resided within 6 localizations collected from the Nuclear Protein Database (NPD). The overall MCC (accuracy) is elevated from 0.284 (50.0\%) to 0.519 (66.5\%) for single-localization proteins in leave-one-out cross-validation; and from 0.420 (65.2\%) to 0.541 (65.2\%) for an independent set of multi-localization proteins. The new system is available at http://array.bioengr.uic.edu/subnuclear.htm. CONCLUSION: The prediction of protein subnuclear localizations can be largely influenced by various definitions of similarity for a pair of proteins based on different similarity measures of GO terms. Using the sum of similarity scores over the matched GO term pairs for two proteins as the similarity definition produced the best predictive outcome. Substantial improvement in predicting protein subnuclear localizations has been achieved by combining Gene Ontology with sequence information.},

Neither acetamidoacetone nor N,N-diacetylaminoacetone showed evidence of appreciable hydration in dilute aqueous solution, nor was any hydrate detectable in solutions of tosylglycine chloromethyl ketone. Substitution of acetaldehyde with acylamido substituents, as in several potent reversible inhibitors of papain, was found to enhance its equilibrium constant for covalent hydration by an order of magnitude; these inhibitors are about 90\% hydrated in dilute aqueous solution, and their affinity for proteases may have been underestimated accordingly. The effects of deuterium substitution at C-1 of acetaldehyde, on equilibrium addition of oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles, are substantial and vary with the nature of the nucleophile. These isotope effects may be useful as a mean of distinguishing between alternative structures of complexes formed between enzymes and aldehydes.},

In an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities, benzamidoacetaldehyde-1-d has been synthesized, and its properties compared with those of the undeuterated inhibitor. After correction for differences in hydration, the observed effect on inhibition is found to be compatible with formation of a thiohemiacetal. In keeping with this conclusion, benzamidoethanol (a partial analogue of the covalent hydrate) and benzamide, N-methylbenzamide and N-ethylbenzamide (somewhat similar to the free aldehyde in size and hydrophobic character) are found to exhibit negligible affinity for the active site.},

	volume = {46},
	abstract = {Orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP) decarboxylase appears to act upon its substrate without the intervention of metals or other cofactors and without the formation of covalent bonds between the enzyme and the substrate. Crystallographic information indicates that substrate binding forces the substrate's scissile carboxylate group into the neighborhood of several charged groups at the active site. It has been proposed that binding might result in electrostatic stress at the substrate's C6 carboxylate group in such a way as to promote decarboxylation by destabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex in its ground state. If that were the case, one would expect uridine 5'-phosphate (UMP) derivatives with bulky anionic substituents at C6 to be bound weakly compared with UMP, which is unsubstituted at C6. Here, we describe the formation of anionic 5,6-dihydro-6-sulfonyl derivatives by spontaneous addition of sulfite to UMP and to OMP. These sulfite addition reactions, which are slowly reversible and are not catalyzed by the enzyme, result in the appearance of one (or, in the case of OMP, two) bulky anionic substituents at the 6-carbon atom of UMP. These inhibitors are bound with affinities that surpass the binding affinity of UMP. We are led to infer that the active site of OMP decarboxylase is remarkably accommodating in the neighborhood of C6. These are not the properties that one would expect of an active site with a rigid structure that imposes sufficient electrostatic stress on the substrate to produce a major advancement along the reaction coordinate.},

Particularly remarkable are those enzymes that act as simple protein catalysts, without the assistance of metals or other cofactors. To determine the extent to which one such enzyme, human uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, enhances the rate of substrate decarboxylation, we examined the rate of spontaneous decarboxylation of pyrrolyl-3-acetate. Extrapolation of first-order rate constants measured at elevated temperatures indicates that this reaction proceeds with a half-life of 2.3 x 10(9) years at 25 degrees C in the absence of enzyme. This enzyme shows no significant homology with orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase), another cofactorless enzyme that catalyzes a very slow reaction. It is proposed that, in both cases, a protonated basic residue (Arg-37 in the case of human UroD; Lys-93 in the case of yeast ODCase) furnishes a counterion that helps the scissile carboxylate group of the substrate leave water and enter a relatively nonpolar environment, stabilizes the incipient carbanion generated by the departure of CO(2), and supplies the proton that takes its place.},

	abstract = {OMP decarboxylase (ODCase) generates a very large rate enhancement without the assistance of metals or other cofactors. The uncatalyzed decarboxylation of 1-methylorotate in water is shown to involve the monoanion, although uncharged 1-methylorotic acid is decarboxylated at a similar rate. To measure the extent to which the rate of the nonenzymatic decarboxylation of orotate derivatives might be enhanced by their removal from solvent water, the 1-phosphoribosyl moiety of OMP was replaced with 1-substituents that would allow it to enter less polar solvents. When the tetrabutylammonium salt of 1-cyclohexylorotate was transferred from water to a series of dipolar aprotic solvents, its rate of decarboxylation increased markedly, varying with the relative ability of each solvent to release the substrate in the ground state from stabilization by solvent water acting as a proton donor. These findings are consistent with the view that separation of the substrate from solvent water may contribute, at least to a limited extent, to the rate enhancement produced by ODCase. This enzyme's active site, like that of another cofactorless enzyme recently shown to produce a rate enhancement similar in magnitude (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase), is equipped with an ammonium group positioned in such a way as to balance the electrostatic charge of the carboxylate group of the substrate and later supply a proton to the incipient carbanion in a relatively waterless environment.},

	abstract = {During the initial event in protein self-splicing, a peptide bond to the nitrogen atom of an internal cysteine or serine residue is usually cleaved by the side chain -SH or -OH group to yield a thioester or oxyester intermediate that undergoes further reactions. Self-splicing reactions also accompany the maturation of hedgehog signaling proteins, plant-type asparaginases, and pyruvoyl enzymes. It would be of interest to know whether peptide bonds that involve the nitrogen atoms of cysteine or serine are more susceptible to cleavage than peptide bonds to amino acids that lack reactive side chains. Extrapolations of the results of model reactions conducted at elevated temperatures indicate that the -SH group of N-acetylcysteine enhances the rate of its hydrolysis by a factor of 70, while the OH group of N-acetylserine enhances the rate of its hydrolysis 12-fold, compared with the rate of hydrolysis of N-acetylalanine in neutral solution at 25 degrees C. Several lines of evidence suggest that the rate-enhancing effects of these -SH and -OH side chains arise from their ability to act as intramolecular general acid-base catalysts for hydrolysis, rather than as nucleophilic catalysts. The protein environment within self-splicing proteins appears to redirect the actions of these side chains to nucleophilic attack, generating rate enhancements that approach the rate enhancements generated by conventional enzymes.},

The similar reactivities of methylguanidine and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine and their negative entropies of activation imply that their decomposition proceeds by hydrolysis rather than elimination. The influence of changing pH on the rate of decomposition is consistent with attack by hydroxide ion on the methylguanidinium ion (k2 = 5 x 10(-6) M(-1) s(-1) at 25 degrees C) or with the kinetically equivalent attack by water on uncharged methylguanidine. At 25 degrees C and pH 7, N-methylguanidine is several orders of magnitude more stable than acetamidine, urea, or acetamide. Under the same conditions, the enzymes arginase and agmatinase accelerate substrate hydrolysis 4 x 10(14)-fold and 6 x 10(12)-fold, respectively, by mechanisms that appear to involve metal-mediated water attack. Arginine deiminase accelerates substrate hydrolysis 6 x 10(12)-fold by a mechanism that (in contrast to the mechanisms employed by arginase and agmatinase) is believed to involve attack by an active-site cysteine residue.},

Orthogonal encoding, employing 20 numbers to describe the amino acid type of one protein residue, is often used with artificial neural network (ANN) models. However, this can increase the model complexity, thus leading to difficulty in implementation and poor performance. Here, we use ANNs to derive encoding schemes for the amino acid types from protein three-dimensional structure alignments. Each of the 20 amino acid types is characterized with a few real numbers. Our schemes are tested on the simulation of amino acid substitution matrices. These simplified schemes outperform the orthogonal encoding on small data sets. Using one of these encoding schemes, we generate a colouring scheme for the amino acids in which comparable amino acids are in similar colours.

Btk is a member of the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and plays a vital, but diverse, modulatory role in many cellular processes. Mutations affecting Btk block B-lymphocyte development. Btk is conserved among species, and in this review, we present the sequence of the full-length rat Btk and find it to be analogous to the mouse Btk sequence. We have also analyzed the wealth of information compiled in the mutation database for XLA (BTKbase), representing 554 unique molecular events in 823 families and demonstrate that only selected amino acids are sensitive to replacement (P {\textless} 0.001). Although genotype-phenotype correlations have not been established in XLA, based on these findings, we hypothesize that this relationship indeed exists. Using short interfering-RNA technology, we have previously generated active constructs downregulating Btk expression. However, application of recently established guidelines to enhance or decrease the activity was not successful, demonstrating the importance of the primary sequence. We also review the outcome of expression profiling, comparing B lymphocytes from XLA-, Xid-, and Btk-knockout (KO) donors to healthy controls. Finally, in spite of a few genes differing in expression between Xid- and Btk-KO mice, in vivo competition between cells expressing either mutation shows that there is no selective survival advantage of cells carrying one genetic defect over the other. We conclusively demonstrate that for the R28C-missense mutant (Xid), there is no biologically relevant residual activity or any dominant negative effect versus other proteins.},

Whether or not multiclonal primary prostate cancers typically give rise to multiclonal or monoclonal prostate cancer metastases is largely unknown, although studies at single chromosomal loci are consistent with the latter case. Here we show through a high-resolution genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism and copy number survey that most, if not all, metastatic prostate cancers have monoclonal origins and maintain a unique signature copy number pattern of the parent cancer cell while also accumulating a variable number of separate subclonally sustained changes. We find no relationship between anatomic site of metastasis and genomic copy number change pattern. Taken together with past animal and cytogenetic studies of metastasis and recent single-locus genetic data in prostate and other metastatic cancers, these data indicate that despite common genomic heterogeneity in primary cancers, most metastatic cancers arise from a single precursor cancer cell.

Nucleoside analogues where the leaving NH(3) group is replaced by a proton and prevent conversion of the transition state to product are very potent inhibitors of the enzyme. However, stable carbocyclic versions of these analogues are less effective as the role of the ribose in facilitating formation of hydrated species is abolished. The discovery that a 1,3-diazepinone riboside (4) operated as a tight-binding inhibitor of CDA independent of hydration provided the opportunity to study novel inhibitors built as conformationally locked, carbocyclic 1,3-diazepinone nucleosides to determine the enzyme's conformational preference for a specific form of sugar pucker. This work describes the synthesis of two target bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane nucleosides, locked as north (5) and south (6) conformers, as well as a flexible analogue (7) built with a cyclopentane ring. The seven-membered 1,3-diazepinone ring in all the three targets was built from the corresponding benzoyl-protected carbocyclic bis-allyl ureas by ring-closing metathesis.

We confirm previous results stating that linear classifiers obtain higher performance than non-linear classifiers using orthonormal encoding, but we also show that using Karhunen-Loeve transform the performance of neural networks are comparable to one of linear support vector machines. Finally we propose a new hierarchical approach that, for the first time, combines ideas derived from the machine learning methodologies and from a knowledge base of this particular problem. This approach proves to be a successful attempt to obtain a drastically error reduction with respect to the performance of linear classifiers: the error rate decreases from 9.1\% using linear-SVM to 6.6\% using our new hierarchical classifier based on some pattern rules.},

When installed, users can use search facilities to find and import gene and protein sequences from the EuPathDB databases. Users can then use the functions of Geneious to process the sequence information. When information unique to PlasmoDB and PiroplasmaDB is required, the user can access results linked with the gene/protein sequence via the default web browser. The plugins are freely available from the Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium website. The plugins can be modified to access any of the databases of EuPathDB.},

	volume = {102},
	abstract = {Based on a variety of genetic, biochemical, and neuropathological evidence, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been suggested to be causal in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta has been shown to mediate neurodegenerative and inflammatory changes associated with amyloid plaques, as well as exert direct neurotoxicity through oligomeric forms of Abeta. The mechanism of Abeta toxicity, however, remains largely unknown. In this work, we show that an early event after exposure of postmitotic neurons to Abeta is tyrosine phosphorylation of FISH adapter protein. FISH binds to and potentially regulates certain ADAM family members. We present evidence that FISH and ADAM12 mediate the neurotoxic effect of Abeta. Expression of an ADAM12 protease-deficient mutant (ADAM12DeltaMP) blocks Abeta-induced neuronal death, and expression of an N-terminal fragment of FISH reduces Abeta toxicity. The C-terminal fragment of FISH containing the ADAMs binding region is found to be sufficient for induction of neuronal death, which is prevented by coexpression of the ADAM12DeltaMP. Abeta treatment, as well as expression of the C-terminal toxic FISH fragment, induces accumulation of ADAM12 N-terminal cleavage product in conditioned medium, demonstrating activation of the ADAM metalloprotease/sheddase activity. ADAM12 protein is reduced in AD brains, pointing to a possible increase in ADAM12 proteolytic activity. These data suggest that Abeta toxicity is mediated by FISH and ADAM12 and may provide insights into therapeutic strategies for AD treatment.},

Mutations of the surrounding residues have been shown to cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Substitutions R562P and A582V were noticed to have impaired kinase activity. However, based on Western blot analysis, the mutant proteins were expressed at normal levels. Molecular modeling of the kinase domain has previously indicated that these residues presumably govern the position of the W563 side chain, which is thought to interact with the catalytic loop. W563 is inside the molecule and too far away from the catalytic center to interact directly with the substrate or cofactors. To prove these model-based conclusions, a conservative substitution with phenylalanine for W563 was made, and the resultant mutant lacked kinase activity. These results confirm our previous assumption that the side chain of W563, invariant in protein tyrosine kinases, is crucial for Btk kinase activity. Mutations in the surrounding residues seem to inactivate Btk by affecting the location of W563.},

We now report a novel short TRbeta1 RNA splice variant in humans lacking 35 nucleotides at the 3' end of the non-coding exon 1 due to an alternative 5' splice donor site. This short variant was first identified in sequences of cDNA obtained from cultured human fibroblasts. Both variants were found in human fibroblasts, brain, pituitary, adrenal gland, placenta, muscle, thyroid and lymphocytes. These TRbeta1 variants possess splice donor sites with a sequence score slightly favoring the TRbeta1 long variant. Variant-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that their relative proportions were equal except in pituitary and muscle, in which the long form was 3- and 5-fold in excess. T3 treatment of fibroblasts grown in thyroid hormone depleted medium did not affect the absolute or relative expression of the two variants. Furthermore, the expression level in fibroblasts from patients with resistance to thyroid hormone with or without TRbeta gene mutations was not different to that in fibroblasts from normal controls.},

	volume = {250},
	abstract = {HIV-1 Nef has previously been shown to bind to Src homology-3 (SH3) domains of a subset of Src family tyrosine kinases. In addition, Nef has been reported to coprecipitate with a serine/threonine kinase activity termed NAK (for Nef-associated kinase). The identity of NAK remains uncertain, but it has been suggested to represent a novel member of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family. We report here that NAK autophosphorylation is increased not only by an activated form of the p21-family GTPase cdc42 but also by a plasma membrane-targeted fragment of the adapter protein Nck, thus providing further evidence that NAK is related to PAKs. A detailed structure-based mutational analysis of Nef revealed that all amino acid changes that inhibited the Nef/Hck-SH3 interaction, as measured by surface-plasmon resonance, also abolished coprecipitation of NAK. As PAK family proteins do not contain SH3 domains, these observations are best explained by a protein complex in which Nef, NAK, and an SH3-protein all contact each other. In addition, a number of conserved amino acids in Nef that are not involved in SH3 binding were also found to be crucial for association with NAK. Molecular modeling suggests that these residues are involved in formation of an adjacent binding surface for NAK or another critical component of the NAK/Nef complex.},

	abstract = {PRINCIPLES: Amyloids are highly cross-beta-sheet-rich aggregated states that confer protease resistance, membrane activity and multivalence properties to proteins, all essential features for the undesired preservation of food proteins transiting the gastrointestinal tract and causing type I allergy. METHODS: Amyloid propensity of beta-parvalbumin, the major fish allergen, was theoretically analysed and assayed under gastrointestinal-relevant conditions using the binding of thioflavin T, the formation of sodium dodecyl sulphate- (SDS-) resistant aggregates, circular dichroism spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy fibril imaging. Impact of amyloid aggregates on allergenicity was assessed with dot blot. RESULTS: Sequences of beta-parvalbumin from species with commercial value contain several adhesive hexapeptides capable of driving amyloid formation. Using Atlantic cod beta-parvalbumin (rGad m 1) displaying high IgE cross-reactivity, we found that formation of amyloid fibres under simulated gastrointestinal conditions accounts for the resistance to acid and neutral proteases, for the presence of membrane active species under gastrointestinal relevant conditions and for the IgE-recognition in the sera of allergic patients. Incorporation of the anti-amyloid compound epigallocatechin gallate prevents rGad m 1 fibrillation, facilitates its protease digestion and impairs its recognition by IgE. CONCLUSIONS: the formation of amyloid by rGad m 1 explains its degradation resistance, its facilitated passage across the intestinal epithelial barrier and its epitope architecture as allergen.},

It is shown that the biolistic delivery of mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) materials can be improved by increasing the density of MSNs through gold plating. Additionally, a DNA-coating protocol is used based on calcium chloride and spermidine for MSN and gold nanorods to enhance the NP-mediated DNA delivery. Furthermore, the drastic improvement of NP delivery is demonstrated when the particles are combined with 0.6 mum gold particles during bombardment.

Cleavage in the membrane-spanning portion of the signal peptide promotes the release of signal peptide fragments from the lipid bilayer. Typical processes that include intramembrane proteolysis is the regulatory or signalling function of cleavage products. Likewise, signal peptide fragments liberated upon intramembrane cleavage may promote such post-targeting functions in the cell.},

	abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that presenilins (PSs) and signal peptide peptidase (SPP) are members of a novel protease family of integral membrane proteins that may utilize a catalytic mechanism similar to classic aspartic proteases such as pepsin, renin and cathepsin D. The defining features of the PSs and SPP are their ability to cleave substrate polypeptides within a transmembrane region, the presence of two active site aspartate residues in adjacent membrane-spanning regions and a conserved PAL motif near their COOH-terminus. PSs appear to be the catalytic subunit of multiprotein complexes that possess gamma-secretase activity. Because this activity generates the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) deposited in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), PSs are considered therapeutic targets in AD. In contrast to PSs that are not active unless part of a larger complex, SPP does not appear to require protein co-factors. Because of its requirement for hepatitis C virus maturation and a possible immune modulatory role, SPP is also considered a potential therapeutic target. Four additional PS/SPP homologs have been identified in humans; yet, their functions have not been elucidated. Herein, we will review the recent advances in our understanding of the PS/SPP family of proteases as well as discuss aspects of intramembrane cleavage that are not well understood.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several predisposition loci for hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) have been suggested, including HPCX1 at Xq27-q28, but due to the complex structure of the region, the susceptibility gene has not yet been identified. METHODS: In this study, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) inhibition was used for the discovery of truncating mutations. Six prostate cancer (PC) patients and their healthy brothers were selected from a group of HPCX1-linked families. Expression analyses were done using Agilent 44 K oligoarrays, and selected genes were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. In addition, microRNA expression levels in the lymphoblastic cells were analyzed to trace variants that might alter miRNA expression and explain partly an inherited genetic predisposion to PC. RESULTS: Seventeen genes were selected for resequencing based on the NMD array, but no truncating mutations were found. The most interesting variant was MAGEC1 p.Met1?. An association was seen between the variant and unselected PC (OR = 2.35, 95\% CI = 1.10-5.02) and HPC (OR = 3.38, 95\% CI = 1.10-10.40). miRNA analysis revealed altogether 29 miRNAs with altered expression between the PC cases and controls. miRNA target analysis revealed that 12 of them also had possible target sites in the MAGEC1 gene. These miRNAs were selected for validation process including four miRNAs located in the X chromosome. The expressions of 14 miRNAs were validated in families that contributed to the significant signal differences in Agilent arrays. CONCLUSIONS: Further functional studies are needed to fully understand the possible contribution of these miRNAs and MAGEC1 start codon variant to PC.},

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase, in which mutations cause a hereditary immunodeficiency disease, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Mutations have been found in all Btk domains, including SH2. We have analyzed the structural and functional effects of six disease-related amino acid substitutions in the SH2 domain: G302E, R307G, Y334S, L358F, Y361C, and H362Q. Also, we present a novel Btk SH2 missense mutation, H362R, leading to classical XLA. Based on circular dichroism analysis, the conformation of five of the XLA mutants studied differs from the native Btk SH2 domain, while mutant R307G is structurally identical. The binding of XLA mutation-containing SH2 domains to pY-Sepharose was reduced, varying between 1 and 13\% of that for the native SH2 domain. The solubility of all the mutated proteins was remarkably reduced. SH2 domain mutations were divided into three categories: 1) Functional mutations, which affect residues presumably participating directly in pY binding (R307G); 2) structural mutations that, via conformational change, not only impair pY binding, but severely derange the structure of the SH2 domain and possibly interfere with the overall conformation of the Btk molecule (G302E, Y334S, L358F, and H362Q); and 3) structural-functional mutations, which contain features from both categories above (Y361C).},

	title = {Role of enzyme-ribofuranosyl contacts in the ground state and transition state for orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase: a role for substrate destabilization?},
	volume = {40},
	abstract = {The crystal structure of yeast orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase) complexed with the inhibitor 6-hydroxyuridine 5'-phosphate (BMP) reveals the presence of a series of strong interactions between enzyme residues and functional groups of this ligand. Enzyme contacts with the phosphoribofuranosyl moiety of orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP) have been shown to contribute at least 16.6 kcal/mol of intrinsic binding free energy to the stabilization of the transition state for the reaction catalyzed by yeast ODCase. In addition to these enzyme-ligand contacts, active site residues contributed by both subunits of the dimeric enzyme are positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the 2'- and 3'-OH groups of the ligand's ribosyl moiety. These involve Thr-100 of one subunit and Asp-37 of the opposite subunit, respectively. To evaluate the contributions of these ribofuranosyl contacts to ground state and transition state stabilization, Thr-100 and Asp-37 were each mutated to alanine. Elimination of the enzyme's capacity to contact individual ribosyl OH groups reduced the k(cat)/K(m) value of the T100A enzyme by 60-fold and that of the D37A enzyme by 300-fold. Removal of the 2'-OH group from the substrate OMP decreased the binding affinity by less than a factor of 10, but decreased k(cat) by more that 2 orders of magnitude. Upon removal of the complementary hydroxymethyl group from the enzyme, little further reduction in k(cat)/K(m) for 2'-deoxyOMP was observed. To assess the contribution made by contacts involving both ribosyl hydroxyl groups at once, the ability of the D37A mutant enzyme to decarboxylate 2'-deoxyOMP was measured. The value of k(cat)/K(m) for this enzyme-substrate pair was 170 M(-1) s(-1), representing a decrease of more than 7.6 kcal/mol of binding free energy in the transition state. To the extent that electrostatic repulsion in the ground state can be tested by these simple alterations, the results do not lend obvious support to the view that electrostatic destabilization in the ground state enzyme-substrate complex plays a major role in catalysis.},

	abstract = {Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase produces the largest rate enhancement that has been reported for any enzyme. The crystal structure of the recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme has been determined in the absence and presence of the proposed transition state analog 6-hydroxyuridine 5'-phosphate, at a resolution of 2.1 A and 2.4 A, respectively. Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase folds as a TIM-barrel with the ligand binding site near the open end of the barrel. The binding of 6-hydroxyuridine 5'-phosphate is accompanied by protein loop movements that envelop the ligand almost completely, forming numerous favorable interactions with the phosphoryl group, the ribofuranosyl group, and the pyrimidine ring. Lysine-93 appears to be anchored in such a way as to optimize electrostatic interactions with developing negative charge at C-6 of the pyrimidine ring, and to donate the proton that replaces the carboxylate group at C-6 of the product. In addition, H-bonds from the active site to O-2 and O-4 help to delocalize negative charge in the transition state. Interactions between the enzyme and the phosphoribosyl group anchor the pyrimidine within the active site, helping to explain the phosphoribosyl group's remarkably large contribution to catalysis despite its distance from the site of decarboxylation.},

When Tyr-217 and Arg-235 are individually mutated to alanine, values of k(cat)/K(m) are reduced by factors of 3000- and 7300-fold, respectively. In the Y217A/R235A double mutant, activity is reduced more than 10(7)-fold.

Activity toward orotate is not "rescued" by 1 M inorganic phosphate. The K(i) value of ribose 5'-phosphate, representing the part of the natural substrate that is absent in orotic acid, is 8.1 x 10(-5) M. Thus, the effective concentration of the 5'-phosphoribosyl group, in stabilizing the transition state for enzymatic decarboxylation of OMP, is estimated to be {\textgreater}2 x 10(8) M, representing one of the largest connectivity effects that has been reported for an enzyme reaction.},

Here we report the results of mutagenesis of each of the charged active site residues and Gln-215. The activities of the Q215A and wild-type enzymes were equal indicating that any interactions between this residue and the pyrimidine ring are dispensable for efficient decarboxylation. For the D91A and K93A mutant enzymes, activity was reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude and substrate binding could not be detected by isothermal calorimetry. For the D96A mutant enzyme, k(cat) was reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude, and isothermal calorimetry indicated an 11-fold decrease in the affinity of this enzyme for the substrate in the ground state. For the K59A enzyme, k(cat) was reduced by a factor of 130, and K(m) had increased by a factor of 900.

	volume = {71},
	abstract = {Enzymes are called upon to differ greatly in the difficulty of the tasks that they perform. The catalytic proficiency of an enzyme can be evaluated by comparing the second-order rate constant (kcat/Km) with the rate of the spontaneous reaction in neutral solution in the absence of a catalyst. The proficiencies of enzymes, measured in this way, are matched by their affinity constants for the altered substrate in the transition state. These values vary from approximately approximately 10(9) M(-1) for carbonic anhydrase to approximately 10(23) M(-1) for yeast orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (ODCase). ODCase turns its substrate over with a half-time of 18 ms, in a reaction that proceeds in its absence with a half-time of 78 million years in neutral solution. ODCase differs from other decarboxylases in that its catalytic activity does not depend on the presence of metals or other cofactors, or on the formation of a covalent bond to the substrate. Several mechanisms of transition state stabilization are considered in terms of ODCase crystal structures observed in the presence and absence of bound analogs of the substrate, transition state, and product. Very large connectivity effects are indicated by the results of experiments testing how transition state stabilization is affected by the truncation of binding determinants of the substrate and the active site.},

To elucidate the targeting properties of the bacterial LT-B protein and BSP in plant systems, the subcellular localization of visual marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to LT-B and various combinations of signal peptides was examined in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic maize. Biochemical analysis indicates that the LT-B::GFP fusion proteins can assemble and fold properly retaining both the antigenicity of LT-B and the fluorescing properties of GFP. Maize kernel fractionation revealed that transgenic lines carrying BSP result in recombinant protein association with fibre and starch fractions. Confocal microscopy analysis indicates that the fusion proteins accumulate in the endomembrane system of plant cells in a signal peptide-dependent fashion. This is the first report providing evidence of the ability of a bacterial signal peptide to target proteins to the plant secretory pathway. The results provide important insights for further understanding the heterologous protein trafficking mechanisms and for developing effective strategies in molecular farming.},

This work describes fractionation by wet-milling of transgenic maize expressing the B subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT-B), a potent immunogen and candidate for oral vaccine and vaccine components. The LT-B gene was directed to express in seed by an endosperm specific promoter. Two steeping treatments, traditional steeping (TS, 0.2\% SO(2) + 0.5\% lactic acid) and water steeping (WS, water only), were evaluated to determine effects on recovery of functional LT-B in wet-milled fractions. The overall recovery of the LT-B protein from WS treatment was 1.5-fold greater than that from TS treatment. In both steeping types, LT-B was distributed similarly among the fractions, resulting in enrichment of functional LT-B in fine fiber, coarse fiber and pericarp fractions by concentration factors of 1.5 to 8 relative to the whole kernels on a per-mass basis. Combined with endosperm-specific expression and secretory pathway targeting, wet-milling enables enrichment of high-value recombinant proteins in low-value fractions, such as the fine fiber, and co-utilization of remaining fractions in alternative industrial applications.},

Furthermore, the obturation time for the two techniques was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven roots with oval and ribbon-shaped canals were prepared using Profile Ni-Ti rotary files. After preparation, the roots were randomly allocated to two groups according to root filling technique. All roots were filled with AH plus and gutta-percha. Group 1 was filled using LCT (n = 34) and group 2 was filled using HT (n = 33). The obturation time was measured in 30 cases evenly distributed between the two techniques. Voids in relation to the root canal fillings were assessed using cross-section images from Micro-computed Tomography scans. RESULTS: All root canal fillings had voids. Permutation test showed no statistically significant difference between the two root filling techniques in relation to presence of voids (p = 0.092). A statistically significant difference in obturation time between the two techniques was found (p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study found no statistically significant difference in percentage of voids between two root filling techniques.

Both the sucrose degradation rate and the glucose and fructose consumption rate have been investigated. In all experiments, satisfied amounts of invertase were produced so that all sucrose was cleaved into its monomers. While glucose and fructose as sole carbon sources were consumed with the same uptake rate, a clear preference for glucose uptake was detected in cultivations with sucrose as sole carbon source or mixed substrates when compared with fructose. Nevertheless, no real diauxie could be observed because of partly simultaneous consumption of both monosaccharides. Fructose being present in the cultivation medium at the beginning of the fermentation led to the retardation of glucose uptake. This effect was observed for various fructose starting concentrations in the range of 5-85 g/l.},

Consomic rats SSBN6 [BN chromosome (CH) 6 placed in SS rat] and SSBN2 (BN CH 2 placed in SS rat) have TSH concentrations intermediate between pure SS and BN strains (2.9 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). Candidate genes on rat CH 2 included TSH beta-subunit and on CH 6 the TSH receptor (TSHR). TSH from sera of BN, SS, SSBN6, and SSBN2 strains had similar in vitro bioactivity suggesting that the cause for the variable TSH concentrations was not due to an altered TSH. Physiological response to TSH was measured by changes in serum T(4) concentrations upon administration of bovine TSH (bTSH). Rat strain SS had a greater T(4) response to bTSH than BN (change in T(4), 1.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 microg/dl, P {\textless} 0.005), suggesting reduced thyrocyte sensitivity to TSH in BN. Sequencing of the TSHR coding region revealed an amino acid difference in BN (Q46R). This substitution is unlikely to contribute to the strain difference in serum TSH because both TSHR variants were equally expressed at the cell surface of transfected cells and responsive to bTSH. Given similar TSH activity and similar TSHR structure, TSHR mRNA expression in thyroid tissue was quantitated by real-time PCR. BN had 54 +/- 5\% the total TSHR expression compared to SS (100 +/- 7\%, P {\textless} 0.0001), when corrected for GAPDH expression, a difference confirmed at the protein level. Therefore, the higher TSH level in the BN strain appears to reflect an adjustment of the feedback loop to reduced thyrocyte sensitivity to TSH secondary to reduced TSHR expression.

Its effects were thought to be principally mediated through triiodothyronine (T3), acting as a ligand for the nuclear TH receptors (TRs) alpha and beta residing on thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the promoter of TH target genes. In this classical model of TH action, T3 binding to TRs leads to recruitment of basal transcription factors and increased transcription of TH responsive genes.Recently, the concept of TH action on gene expression has become more diverse and now includes nonclassical actions of T3 and T4: T3 has been shown to activate PI3K via the TRs, which ultimately increases transcription of certain genes, e.g. HIF-1alpha. Additionally, both T3 and thyroxine (T4) can bind to a membrane integrin, alphavbeta3, which leads to activation of the PI3K and MAPK signal transduction pathways and finally also increases gene transcription, e.g. of the FGF2 gene. Therefore, these initially nongenomic, nonclassical actions seem to serve as additional interfaces for transcriptional regulation by TH. Aim of this perspective is to summarize the genes that are currently known to be induced by nonclassical TH action and the mechanisms involved.},

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) action is mediated principally through binding of the hormone ligand, 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3), to TH receptors (TRs). This hormone-receptor interaction recruits other proteins to form complexes that regulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequences in the promoter of target genes. We recently described an extranuclear mechanism of TH action that consists of the association of TH-liganded TRbeta with p85alpha [regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)] in the cytosol and subsequent activation of the PI3K, generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. This initiates the activation of a signaling cascade by phosphorylation of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its substrate p70(S6K), leading to the stimulation of ZAKI-4alpha synthesis, a calcineurin inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that this same mechanism leads to induction of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha), and its target genes, glucose transporter (GLUT)1, platelet-type phosphofructokinase (PFKP), and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4. These genes are of special interest, because their products have important roles in cellular glucose metabolism, from glucose uptake (GLUT1) to glycolysis (PFKP) and lactate export (MCT4). These results demonstrate that the TH-TRbeta complex can exert a non-genomic action in the cytosol leading to changes in gene expression by direct (HIF-1alpha) and indirect (ZAKI-4alpha, GLUT1, PFKP) means.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) effects are mediated through T(3), which regulates gene expression by binding to the nuclear TH receptors, TRalpha and TRbeta. Using microarrays and real-time PCR we found mRNAs of the following genes increased in response to T(3) in a TRbeta-specific manner: the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, its target genes glucose transporter (GLUT)1 and platelet-type phosphofructokinase (PFKP), and the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4. The products of these genes have important roles in cellular glucose metabolism. HIF-1alpha expression and activity can be regulated through phosphatidylinositol-OH-3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPK signaling; thus the possibility of alternative, nonnuclear pathways of TH action was raised. We examined the involvement of these pathways in mediating TH effects by treating human skin fibroblasts with 2 nm T(3) in the absence or presence of either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the MAPK inhibitor PD98059. T(3) induced HIF-1alpha mRNA by 2.7-fold (+/-0.4; P {\textless} 0.013). This increase was completely abrogated by LY294002 (1.1 +/- 0.1; nonsignificant = 0.57), but preserved in the presence of PD98059 (2.2 +/- 0.2; P {\textless} 0.009). Western blotting confirmed these results at the protein level, indicating dependency on the PI3K pathway. The same pattern of response was observed for GLUT1, PFKP, and MCT4 expression. To examine whether HIF-1alpha is directly induced, we used the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). T(3) induction of HIF-1alpha mRNA was not affected by CHX, whereas T(3) effect on GLUT1, PFKP, and MCT4 mRNA was completely abrogated by CHX. These results demonstrate that cytosolic activation of the PI3K signaling pathway has a role in TH-mediated direct (HIF-1alpha) and indirect (GLUT1, PFKP, MCT4) gene expression, and possibly provides a link between TH and cellular glucose metabolism in human fibroblasts.},

	abstract = {Human skin fibroblasts are readily accessible cells for propagation in culture without transformation that can serve for direct pathophysiology studies in subjects with inherited diseases. We thus examined by quantitative fluorescent cDNA microarray analysis the effect of thyroid hormone (TH) on the expression of more than 15,000 genes in fibroblasts of two normal individuals. Fibroblasts from two subjects with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) due to mutations in the TH receptor-beta gene were used to confirm the specificity of the hormonal effect by the ability to discriminate between normal cells and cells with a defect in TH action. Microarray analysis identified 148 genes induced by 1.4-fold or more and five genes repressed to 0.7 or less 24 h after treatment with 2 x 10(-9) M T(3). Taking into account duplicate genes, these represented 91 up-regulated and five down-regulated genes, respectively. Confirmation by real-time PCR was obtained in eight of 10 induced and two of three repressed genes that were tested. Further evidence for T(3)-specific induction was provided by a graded dose response absent in fibroblasts from the patients with RTH. The following genes not previously known to be induced by TH were identified and validated: aldo-keto reductase family 1 C1-3, collagen type VI alpha 3, member RAS oncogene family brain antigen RAB3B, platelet phosphofructokinase, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, and enolase 1 alpha. These genes as well as three known to be TH regulated in other species and found in this study also in human cells (glucose transporter 1, solute carrier family 16 member 3, and basic transcription element-binding protein 1) have a variety of regulatory functions in development and metabolism. TH seems to induce these genes by initiating either genomic or nongenomic mechanisms. Surprisingly, TH-mediated down-regulation of fibroblast growth factor 7 and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B persisted in fibroblasts from patients with RTH. This first systematic study of TH-mediated gene expression in normal human cells identifies several new TH-responsive genes and demonstrates that skin fibroblasts are suitable for the study of TH action in health and disease.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: T(4)-binding globulin (TBG) is the main transport protein for T(4) in blood and a member of the superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors. So far, 14 mutations leading to familial complete TBG deficiency have been reported. Eleven of these are caused by mutations leading to truncation of the molecule, and three are caused by single amino acid substitutions. OBJECTIVE: We report and study the complete deficiency TBG variant found in a patient from NeuIsenburg, Germany (TBG-CDNI). METHODS: Direct DNA sequencing was used to identify the TBG-CDNI mutation in the propositus, which was confirmed by allele-specific amplification. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes was used to study the secretion defect of TBG-CDNI and several variants by Western blot and T(4)-binding assay. RESULTS: The deletion of two nucleotides in codon 384 (1211\_1212delTC) causes a frameshift altering the last 11 residues, introduces a new glycosylation site, and elongates the molecule by seven new amino acids. In contrast to normal TBG, TBG-CDNI was not secreted by Xenopus oocytes. Elongation of normal TBG by seven alanines did not affect its secretion or binding properties. On the other hand, neither disruption of its new glycosylation site nor termination of TBG-CDNI at the normal length repaired its secretion defect. CONCLUSIONS: In this first late termination variant of complete TBG deficiency, alteration of beta-strand 5B, located in the core of the molecule, rather than elongation of the molecule or introduction of a new glycosylation site, suffices to disrupt secretion of TBG-CDNI.},

	abstract = {Thyroid hormones (THs) may play a role in diseases other than hyper- and hypothyroidism. Several lines of evidence suggest tumor-promoting effects of TH and TH receptors. They are possibly mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and MAPK and involve among others stimulation of angiogenesis via alphavbeta3. Thus, an increased risk for colon, lung, prostate, and breast cancer with lower TSH has been demonstrated in epidemiological studies, even suggesting a TH dose effect on cancer occurrence. Furthermore, higher TH levels were associated with an advanced clinical stage of breast and prostate cancer. In rodent models, TH stimulated growth and metastasis of tumor transplants, whereas hypothyroidism had opposite effects. In clinical studies of glioblastoma and head and neck cancer, hypothyroid patients showed longer survival than euthyroid patients. Also, patients with renal cell cancer that were treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib and developed hypothyroidism in due course showed significantly longer survival than patients that remained euthyroid. Development of hypothyroidism was an independent predictor for survival in two studies. Yet, it is still possible that hypothyroidism is only a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy and does not positively influence treatment outcome by itself. Future cancer treatment studies, especially with substances that can induce hypothyroidism, should therefore be designed in a way that allows for an analysis of thyroid function status and its contribution on treatment outcome.},

	volume = {119},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Thyroid hormone (TH) mediated changes in gene expression were thought to be primarily initiated by the nuclear TH receptor (TR) binding to a thyroid hormone response element in the promoter of target genes. A recently described extranuclear mechanism of TH action consists of the association of TH-liganded TRbeta with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the cytosol and subsequent activation of the PI3K pathway. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of TH, TRbeta and PI3K on stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) expression in human cells. DESIGN: We treated human skin fibroblasts with triiodothyronine (T3) in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, a dominant negative PI3K subunit, Deltap85alpha, and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). The role of the TRbeta was studied in cells from patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). STC-1 mRNA expression was measured by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We found an induction of STC1 by T3 in normal cells, but less in cells from subjects with RTH (2.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.04, P {\textless} 0.01). The effect of T3 was completely abrogated by blocking PI3K with LY294002 (3.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.5; P {\textless} 0.05) and greatly reduced after transfection of a dominant negative PI3K subunit, demonstrating dependency on the PI3K pathway. CONCLUSION: These results establish STC1 as a TH target gene in humans. Furthermore, we show that STC1 induction by TH depends on both TRbeta and PI3K activation.},

	volume = {17},
	abstract = {Humans expressing one allele of the thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) gene have neurological symptoms and increased serum TSH with variable degrees of hypothyroidism. Ttf1+/- mice have also poor coordination and increased serum TSH concentration (205 +/- 22 vs. 92 +/- 12 mU/liter; P {\textless} 0.001) and slightly lower T4 (46 +/- 3 vs. 63 +/- 6 nmol/liter; P {\textless} 0.02) as compared with Ttf1+/+ mice. To determine whether the hypothyroidism is of central or primary origin, we examined the bioactivity of TSH, thyroidal response to exogenous TSH and the expression of genes regulated by TTF1. TSH bioactivity was normal, but T4 response to a low but not high dose of TSH was significantly reduced in the Ttf1+/- mice (5.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 15.3 +/- 4.1 nmol/liter; P {\textless} 0.03), indicating a reduced thyroidal response. Thyroid mRNAs were measured by real-time PCR (Ttf1+/+ littermates = 100\%). Ttf1+/- mice had half the levels of TTF1 mRNA (54 +/- 9; P {\textless} 0.01) and protein, confirming their haploinsufficiency. Significantly lower levels of mRNAs were observed for two of the three genes with TTF1 cis elements: TSH receptor (TSHr, 57 +/- 4\%; P {\textless} 0.002), thyroglobulin (63 +/- 7\%; P {\textless} 0.005), but not thyroid peroxidase (81 +/- 12\%; P {\textgreater} 0.05). No significant difference between the two genotypes was found for Pax8, sodium iodide symporter, and iodothyronine deiodinase 1. These results show that Ttf1 haploinsufficiency causes a reduction in the expression of TSHr and thyroglobulin, genes with TTF1 binding sites in their promoter regions. The low TSHr is only partially compensated by an increase in TSH secretion because T4 remains mildly reduced. However, administration of a larger amount of TSH obliterates the response differences by saturating a reduced amount of receptor.},

In order to support the growth of cells in vitro, calf serum (CS) is usually added to the medium to provide necessary nutrients and growth factors. However, the content of endogenous TH in the CS may obfuscate changes with small doses of TH. We therefore compared the use of TH-depleted medium, either by resin treatment (stripped-CS) or by the use of CS from a thyroidectomized calf (TxCS) for gene expression studies. METHODS: We describe the method for preparing a thyroidectomized calf, harvesting the blood and preparing the serum. We utilized methimazole in conjunction with the thyroidectomy to prevent TH synthesis in the event of regrowth of the thyroid remnant. RESULTS: Total triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine concentrations in TxCS were low at {\textless}30 ng/dL and {\textless}1 microg/dL, respectively. We compared the effect of T(3) on basic transcription element-binding protein (BTEB)1 and stanniocalcin (STC)-1 mRNA expression in human fibroblasts from a normal individual and a subject with resistance to TH (RTH) cultured in stripped-CS to TxCS and demonstrated that with stripped-CS and TxCS differences in the BTEB1 and STC-1 expression of normal and RTH fibroblasts could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: Both stripped-CS and TxCS are suitable to detect subtle differences in TH responsiveness between normal and RTH human skin fibroblasts, yet TxCS is not as costly as stripped-CS and relatively easy to prepare.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Menopause-induced estrogen deficiency increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is related to a shift in regional fat distribution. We tested the hypothesis that estrogen-like isoflavones in soy protein isolate (SPI+) would lessen both regional fat gain and lean loss compared with isoflavone-poor soy (SPI-). DESIGN: Perimenopausal participants (N = 69) were randomly assigned (double-blind) to 24 weeks of treatment (40 g soy or whey protein per day): SPI+ (n = 24), SPI- (n = 24), or whey control (n = 21); each participant had blood drawn in the fasted (12 hours) state, had physical activity assessed, and kept a 5-day food diary. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to examine the effects of SPI+ on regional fat and lean tissue distribution changes in the waist, hip, and thigh regions. RESULTS: Mean body mass increased (P {\textless} 0.01) in each group, but treatment had no effect on gain in overall body mass, fat mass, or lean mass using analysis of variance. In all treatment groups combined, lean mass increased in each region; fat mass increased only in the waist region. Treatment had an effect (P = 0.039) on hip lean mass and a marginal effect (P = 0.077) on thigh fat. Regression analyses revealed that SPI+ diminished the increase in thigh fat (P = 0.018) and heightened the increase in hip lean (P = 0.035) mass. Carbohydrate intake (P = 0.006) and cohort (reflective of season; P = 0.011) contributed to the gain in thigh fat. Total protein intake (P = 0.0012), plasma insulin (P = 0.0034), and physical activity (P = 0.047) contributed to the gain in hip lean mass. CONCLUSIONS: Gain in hip lean mass was greater (P = 0.014) in SPI+ than other groups, but SPI+ did not reduce the disease-promoting menopausal shift in regional fat mass.},

	abstract = {Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase important in B-lymphocyte development, differentiation, and signaling. Btk is a member of the Tec family of kinases. Mutations in the Btk gene lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid) in mice. Activation of Btk triggers a cascade of signaling events that culminates in the generation of calcium mobilization and fluxes, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and transcriptional regulation involving nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). In B cells, NF-kappaB was shown to bind to the Btk promoter and induce transcription, whereas the B-cell receptor-dependent NF-kappaB signaling pathway requires functional Btk. Moreover, Btk activation is tightly regulated by a plethora of other signaling proteins including protein kinase C (PKC), Sab/SH3BP5, and caveolin-1. For example, the prolyl isomerase Pin1 negatively regulates Btk by decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation and steady state levels of Btk. It is intriguing that PKC and Pin1, both of which are negative regulators, bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of Btk. To this end, we describe here novel mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain investigated for their transforming capacity. In particular, we show that the mutant D43R behaves similar to E41K, already known to possess such activity.},

In this study, we first screened for variants in candidate genes and then chose to explore the association between 18 variants and prostate cancer risk by genotyping DNA samples from unselected (n = 847) and familial (n = 121) prostate cancer patients and population controls (n = 923). We identified a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CYP19A1 gene, T201M, with a mild significant association with prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR), 2.04; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 1.03-4.03; P = 0.04]. Stratified analysis revealed that this risk was most apparent in patients with organ-confined (T(1)-T(2)) and low-grade (WHO grade 1) tumors (OR, 5.42; 95\% CI, 2.33-12.6; P {\textless} 0.0001). In contrast, CYP17A1 -34T{\textgreater}C alteration was associated with moderate to poorly differentiated (WHO grade 2-3) organ-confined disease (OR, 1.42; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.83; P = 0.007).

In conclusion, our results suggest that several SNPs along the androgen pathway, especially in CYP19A1 and CYP17A1, may influence prostate cancer development and progression. These genes may have different contributions to distinct clinical subsets as well as combinatorial effects in others illustrating that profiling and joint analysis of several genes along each pathway may be needed to understand genetic contributions to prostate cancer etiology.},

The HSLs are produced by gram-negative bacteria and act as intercellular signals inducing density-dependent gene expression. Compared with the multi-step procedures previously reported, which included chemical extraction, purification and the use of Escherichia coli HSL biosensors, this on-line LC-MS-MS method is fast and detects 11 HSLs. Its speed and robustness allow the analysis of a large number of samples without loss of performance (no signal variation for a control sample after 90 chromatographic injections). The selectivity is based on the MS-MS fragment ions of the molecular [M+H]- ions and on their relative intensities. For quantification, the m/z 102 ion, specific for the lactone ring and detected with a good signal-to-noise ratio, allows low detection limits even in complex matrix samples (0.28 up to 9.3 pmol). Moreover, this method allows the quantification of 11 HSLs whatever their chemical structure, substituted or not. The protocol was applied to Vibrio vulnificus, a marine bacterium.

They characteristically have three domains; a basic region at the N-terminus (n-region), a central hydrophobic core (h-region) and a carboxy-terminal cleavage region (c-region). Although hundreds of different signal peptides have been identified, it has not been completely understood how their features enable signal peptides to influence protein expression. Antibody-derived signal peptides are often used to prepare recombinant antibodies expressed by eukaryotic cells, especially Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, when prokaryotic Escherichia coli (E. coli) are utilized in drug discovery processes, such as for phage display selection or antibody humanization, signal peptides have been selected separately due to the differences in the expression systems between the species. In this study, we successfully established a signal peptide that enables a functional antibody to be expressed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells by focusing on the importance of having an Ala residue in the c-region of the signal sequence. We found that changing Ser to Ala at only two positions significantly augmented the anti-HER2 antigen binding fragment (Fab) expression in E. coli. In addition, this altered signal peptide also retained the ability to express functional anti-HER2 antibody in CHO cells. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the signal peptide can promote functional antibody expression in both prokaryotic E. coli and eukaryotic CHO cells. This finding will contribute to the understanding of signal peptides and accelerate therapeutic antibody research.},

	title = {{CPP}-{ZFN}: a potential {DNA}-targeting anti-malarial drug},
	volume = {9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium is of major concern today. Effective vaccines or successful applications of RNAi-based strategies for the treatment of malaria are currently unavailable. An unexplored area in the field of malaria research is the development of DNA-targeting drugs that can specifically interact with parasitic DNA and introduce deleterious changes, leading to loss of vital genome function and parasite death. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Advances in the development of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) with engineered DNA recognition domains allow us to design and develop nuclease of high target sequence specificity with a mega recognition site that typically occurs only once in the genome. Moreover, cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) can cross the cell plasma membrane and deliver conjugated protein, nucleic acid, or any other cargo to the cytoplasm, nucleus, or mitochondria. This article proposes that a drug from the combination of the CPP and ZFN systems can effectively enter the intracellular parasite, introduce deleterious changes in its genome, and eliminate the parasite from the infected cells. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Availability of a DNA-binding motif for more than 45 triplets and its modular nature, with freedom to change number of fingers in a ZFN, makes development of customized ZFN against diverse target DNA sequence of any gene feasible. Since the Plasmodium genome is highly AT rich, there is considerable sequence site diversity even for the structurally and functionally conserved enzymes between Plasmodium and humans. CPP can be used to deliver ZFN to the intracellular nucleus of the parasite. Signal-peptide-based heterologous protein translocation to Plasmodium-infected RBCs (iRBCs) and different Plasmodium organelles have been achieved. With successful fusion of CPP with mitochondrial- and nuclear-targeting peptides, fusion of CPP with 1 more Plasmodium cell membrane translocation peptide seems achievable. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Targeting of the Plasmodium genome using ZFN has great potential for the development of anti-malarial drugs. It allows the development of a single drug against all malarial infections, including multidrug-resistant strains. Availability of multiple ZFN target sites in a single gene will provide alternative drug target sites to combat the development of resistance in the future.},

LOCtree predicts the subcellular compartment of a protein by mimicking the mechanism of cellular sorting and exploiting a variety of sequence and predicted structural features in its input. Currently LOCtree does not predict localization for membrane proteins, since the compositional properties of membrane proteins significantly differ from those of non-membrane proteins. While any information about function can be used by the system, we present estimates of performance that are valid when only the amino acid sequence of a protein is known. When evaluated on a non-redundant test set, LOCtree achieved sustained levels of 74\% accuracy for non-plant eukaryotes, 70\% for plants, and 84\% for prokaryotes. We rigorously benchmarked LOCtree in comparison to the best alternative methods for localization prediction. LOCtree outperformed all other methods in nearly all benchmarks. Localization assignments using LOCtree agreed quite well with data from recent large-scale experiments. Our preliminary analysis of a few entirely sequenced organisms, namely human (Homo sapiens), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and weed (Arabidopsis thaliana) suggested that over 35\% of all non-membrane proteins are nuclear, about 20\% are retained in the cytosol, and that every fifth protein in the weed resides in the chloroplast.},

Reproducing this unusual hydrolysis within otherwise water-excluding transmembrane regions with purified proteins is a challenging prerequisite for such structural studies. Here we show the bacterial expression, purification, and reconstitution of proteolytically active signal peptide peptidase (SPP), a membrane-embedded enzyme in the presenilin family of aspartyl proteases. This finding formally proves that, unlike presenilin, SPP does not require any additional proteins for proteolysis. Surprisingly, the conserved C-terminal half of SPP is sufficient for proteolytic activity; purification and reconstitution of this engineered fragment of several SPP orthologues revealed that this region defines a functional domain for an intramembrane aspartyl protease. The discovery of minimal requirements for intramembrane proteolysis should facilitate mechanistic and structural analysis and help define general biochemical principles of hydrolysis in a hydrophobic environment.},

The three domains seem to have duplicated together, since the phylogenetic analysis using parsimony gave almost identical evolutionary trees for the separate domains and the multidomain complexes. The congruence analysis of the sequences for the separate domains also suggested that the domains have coevolved. There are several reasons for the domains to appear in a cluster. Kinases are regulated in many ways, and the presence of SH2 and SH3 domains at proper positions is crucial. Because all three domains can recognize different parts of ligands and substrates, their evolution has been interconnected. The reasons for the clustering and coevolution of the three domains in protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are discussed.},

	title = {Improving {N}-terminal protein annotation of {Plasmodium} species based on signal peptide prediction of orthologous proteins},
	volume = {11},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Signal peptide is one of the most important motifs involved in protein trafficking and it ultimately influences protein function. Considering the expected functional conservation among orthologs it was hypothesized that divergence in signal peptides within orthologous groups is mainly due to N-terminal protein sequence misannotation. Thus, discrepancies in signal peptide prediction of orthologous proteins were used to identify misannotated proteins in five Plasmodium species. METHODS: Signal peptide (SignalP) and orthology (OrthoMCL) were combined in an innovative strategy to identify orthologous groups showing discrepancies in signal peptide prediction among their protein members (Mixed groups). In a comparative analysis, multiple alignments for each of these groups and gene models were visually inspected in search of misannotated proteins and, whenever possible, alternative gene models were proposed. Thresholds for signal peptide prediction parameters were also modified to reduce their impact as a possible source of discrepancy among orthologs. Validation of new gene models was based on RT-PCR (few examples) or on experimental evidence already published (ApiLoc). RESULTS: The rate of misannotated proteins was significantly higher in Mixed groups than in Positive or Negative groups, corroborating the proposed hypothesis. A total of 478 proteins were reannotated and change of signal peptide prediction from negative to positive was the most common. Reannotations triggered the conversion of almost 50\% of all Mixed groups, which were further reduced by optimization of signal peptide prediction parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological novelty proposed here combining orthology and signal peptide prediction proved to be an effective strategy for the identification of proteins showing wrongly N-terminal annotated sequences, and it might have an important impact in the available data for genome-wide searching of potential vaccine and drug targets and proteins involved in host/parasite interactions, as demonstrated for five Plasmodium species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Can sequence segments coding for subcellular targeting or for posttranslational modifications occur in proteins that are not substrates in either of these processes? Although considerable effort has been invested in achieving low false-positive prediction rates, even accurate sequence-analysis tools for the recognition of these motifs generate a small but noticeable number of protein hits that lack the appropriate biological context but cannot be rationalized as false positives. RESULTS: We show that the carboxyl termini of a set of definitely non-peroxisomal proteins with predicted peroxisomal targeting signals interact with the peroxisomal matrix protein receptor peroxin 5 (PEX5) in a yeast two-hybrid test. Moreover, we show that examples of these proteins - chicken lysozyme, human tyrosinase and the yeast mitochondrial ribosomal protein L2 (encoded by MRP7) - are imported into peroxisomes in vivo if their original sorting signals are disguised. We also show that even prokaryotic proteins can contain peroxisomal targeting sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, functional localization signals can evolve in unrelated protein sequences as a result of neutral mutations, and subcellular targeting is hierarchically organized, with signal accessibility playing a decisive role. The occurrence of silent functional motifs in unrelated proteins is important for the development of sequence-based function prediction tools and the interpretation of their results. Silent functional signals have the potential to acquire importance in future evolutionary scenarios and in pathological conditions.},

Patients with TMEM127 mutations have been thus far exclusively identified with adrenal tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A population-based series of 48 consecutive individuals from the European-American Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma Registry with multiple paraganglial tumors and, of these, one extraadrenal paraganglial tumor were selected for this study. They all had normal results when screened for germline mutations of the genes RET, VHL, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD. Germline mutation analysis of the TMEM127 gene included a search for intragenic mutations and large rearrangements. RESULTS: Of the 48 eligible patients with extraadrenal paraganglial tumors, two (4.2\%) were found to have TMEM127 mutations. One patient had multiple head and neck paraganglioma and one retroperitoneal extraadrenal and adrenal tumor. CONCLUSION: TMEM127 germline mutations confer risks of extraadrenal paraganglial tumors in addition to the documented adrenal pheochromocytoma. Thus, surveillance for extraadrenal and adrenal paraganglial tumors is likely warranted in TMEM127 mutation carriers, although the true prevalence should be evaluated in patients with extraadrenal paraganglial tumors.},

	abstract = {Lactococcus lactis is an attractive vehicle for biotechnological production of proteins and clinical delivery of therapeutics. In many such applications using this host, it is desirable to maximize secretion of recombinant proteins into the extracellular space, which is typically achieved by using the native signal peptide from a major secreted lactococcal protein, Usp45. In order to further increase protein secretion from L. lactis, inherent limitations of the Usp45 signal peptide (Usp45sp) must be elucidated. Here, we performed extensive mutagenesis on Usp45sp to probe the effects of both the mRNA sequence (silent mutations) and the peptide sequence (amino acid substitutions) on secretion. We screened signal peptides based on their resulting secretion levels of Staphylococcus aureus nuclease and further evaluated them for secretion of Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase. Silent mutations alone gave an increase of up to 16\% in the secretion of alpha-amylase through a mechanism consistent with relaxed mRNA folding around the ribosome binding site and enhanced translation. Targeted amino acid mutagenesis in Usp45sp, combined with additional silent mutations from the best clone in the initial screen, yielded an increase of up to 51\% in maximum secretion of alpha-amylase while maintaining secretion at lower induction levels. The best sequence from our screen preserves the tripartite structure of the native signal peptide but increases the positive charge of the n-region. Our study presents the first example of an engineered L. lactis signal peptide with a higher secretion yield than Usp45sp and, more generally, provides strategies for further enhancing protein secretion in bacterial hosts.},

For some time methods for doing this have been available in the area of protein structure prediction. We have developed a similar procedure based on pair-wise alignments for sequences with functional sites. We show how a correlation coefficient between sequence similarity and functional homology can be used to compare the efficiency of different similarity measures and choose a nonarbitrary threshold value for excluding redundant sequences. The impact of the choice of scoring matrix used in the alignments is examined. We demonstrate that the parameter determining the quality of the correlation is the relative entropy of the matrix, rather than the assumed (PAM or identity) substitution mode. Results are presented for the case of prediction of cleavage sites in signal peptides. By inspection of the false positives, several errors in the database were found. The procedure presented may be used as a general outline for finding a problem-specific similarity measure and threshold value for analysis of other functional amino acid or nucleotide sequence patterns.},

For known signal peptides, the model can be used to assign objective boundaries between these three regions. Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70\% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test–almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

Defects of this gene cause an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency with almost absent T-cells and functionally defective B-cells (T(-)B(+) SCID). Herewith, we present molecular information on the first 27 unique mutations identified in the JAK3 gene, including clinical data on all of the 23 affected patients reported so far. A variety of mutations scattered throughout all seven functional domains of the protein, and with different functional effects, have been identified. Availability of a molecular screening test, based on amplification of genomic DNA, facilitates the diagnostic approach, and has permitted recognition that JAK3 deficiency may also be associated with atypical clinical and immunological features. Development of a structural model of the JAK3 kinase domain has allowed characterization of the functional effects of the various mutations. Most importantly, molecular analysis at the JAK3 locus results in improved genetic counseling, allows early prenatal diagnosis, and prompts appropriate treatment (currently based on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) in affected families.},

	abstract = {There are currently less than 40 locus-specific databases (LSDBs) and one large general database that curate data on somatic mutations in human cancer genes. These databases have different scope and use different annotation standards and database systems, resulting in duplicated efforts in data curation, and making it difficult for users to find clear and consistent information. As data related to somatic mutations are generated at an increasing pace it is urgent to create a framework for improving the collecting of this information and making it more accessible to clinicians, scientists, and epidemiologists to facilitate research on biomarkers. Here we propose a data flow for improving the connectivity between existing databases and we provide practical guidelines for data reporting, database contents, and annotation standards. These proposals are based on common standards recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) with additions related to specific requirements of somatic mutations in cancer. Indeed, somatic mutations may be used in molecular pathology and clinical studies to characterize tumor types, help treatment choice, predict response to treatment and patient outcome, or in epidemiological studies as markers for tumor etiology or exposure assessment. Thus, specific annotations are required to cover these diverse research topics. This initiative is meant to promote collaboration and discussion on these issues and the development of adequate resources that would avoid the loss of extremely valuable information generated by years of basic and clinical research.},

The B cell receptor (BCR) is an integral membrane protein complex that is composed of two Ig heavy chains, two Ig light chains and two heterodimers of Igalpha and Igbeta. To eliminate foreign antigens, B cells cooperate with other cells of the immune system including macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells. B cell development is a tightly controlled process in which over 75\% of the developing cells become apoptotic because of inappropriate immunoglobulin gene rearrangements or recognition of self antigens by Igs. Hence, the majority of B cell-associated disorders are caused by the incorrect function of genes/proteins involved in B cell development.},

	abstract = {It is generally considered mammals and birds have five Tec family kinases (TFKs): Btk, Bmx (also known as Etk), Itk, Tec, and Txk (also known as Rlk). Here, we discuss the domains and their functions and regulation in TFKs. Over the last few years, a large number of genomes from various phyla have been sequenced making it possible to study evolutionary relationships at the molecular and sequence level. Using bioinformatics tools, we for the first time demonstrate that a TFK ancestor exists in the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, which is the closest known relative to metazoans with a sequenced genome. The analysis of the genomes for sponges, insects, hagfish, and frogs suggests that these species encode a single TFK. The insect form has a divergent and unique N-terminal region. Duplications generating the five members took place prior to the emergence of vertebrates. Fishes have two or three forms and the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, has four (lacks Txk). Thus, not all mammals have all five TFKs. The single identified TFK in frogs is an ortholog of Tec. Bmx seems to be unique to mammals and birds. SH3BP5 is a negative regulator of Btk. It is conserved in choanoflagellates and interestingly exists also in nematodes, which do not express TFKs, suggesting a broader function in addition to Btk regulation. The related SH3BP5-like protein is not found in Nematodes.},

The evolutionary history of the human immune system is not well characterised. Although several studies related to the development and evolution of immunological processes have been published, a full-scale genome-based analysis is still missing. A database focused on the evolutionary relationships of immune related genes would contribute to and facilitate research on immunology and evolutionary biology. RESULTS: An Internet resource called ImmTree http://bioinf.uta.fi/ImmTree was constructed for studying the evolution and evolutionary trees of the human immune system. ImmTree contains information about orthologs in 80 species collected from the HomoloGene, OrthoMCL and EGO databases. In addition to phylogenetic trees, the service provides data for the comparison of human-mouse ortholog pairs, including synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates, Z values, and Ka/Ks quotients. A versatile search engine allows complex queries from the database. Currently, data is available for 847 human immune system related genes and proteins. CONCLUSION: ImmTree provides a unique data set of genes and proteins from the human immune system, their phylogenetics, and information for comparisons of human-mouse ortholog pairs, synonymous and non-synonymous mutation rates, as well as other statistical information.},

RESULTS: Here, we present a detailed study of the development of the immunome protein interaction network during eight evolutionary steps from Bilateria ancestors to human. New nodes show preferential attachment to high degree proteins. The efficiency of the immunome protein interaction network increases during the evolutionary steps, whereas the vulnerability of the network decreases. CONCLUSION: Our results shed light on selective forces acting on the emergence of biological networks. It is likely that the high efficiency and low vulnerability are intrinsic properties of many biological networks, which arise from the effects of evolutionary processes yet to be uncovered.},

In an FFE system, this separation is performed entirely in the liquid phase, without the need for particulate chromatographic media, gels, or membranes. Herein, we demonstrated the compatibility of IEF-FFE with ESI-Fourier transform ICR MS (ESI-FTICR-MS) for top-down experiments. We demonstrated that IEF-FFE of intact proteins were highly reproducible between FFE instruments, between laboratories, and between analyses. Applying native (0.2\% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) IEF-FFE to an enzyme resulted in no decrease in enzyme activity; applying either native or denaturing (8 M urea) IEF-FFE to a four-protein mixture with different pIs resulted in isolation of each protein into separate fractions in a 96-well plate. After desalting, each protein was sequenced by top-down MS/MS. As an application of this technique, chicken erythrocyte histone H2A-IV and its major modified forms were enriched by IEF-FFE. Top-down analysis revealed Lys-5 to be a major acetylation site, in addition to N-terminal acetylation.},

Whereas efficient techniques are readily available for the initial identification of interacting protein partners, practical strategies are lacking for the subsequent high-resolution mapping of regions involved in protein-protein interfaces. We present here a genetic strategy to accurately map interacting protein regions at amino acid precision. The system is based on parallel construction, sampling and analysis of a comprehensive insertion mutant library. The methodology integrates Mu in vitro transposition-based random pentapeptide mutagenesis of proteins, yeast two-hybrid screening and high-resolution genetic footprinting. The strategy is general and applicable to any interacting protein pair.

Tryptic fragments of the purified protein were generated, purified, and sequenced. A rat liver cDNA library, constructed in the plasmid vector pUEX1 was screened with oligonucleotides synthesized on the basis of peptide sequences. The obtained clone contained 783 bases predicting to code the entire mature protein of 261 amino acids. The molecular weight of 29,300 predicted from cDNA-derived sequences was consistent with the subunit size determined earlier. A high degree of similarity was noted between the amino acid sequence of isomerase and that of the amino-terminal half of peroxisomal multifunctional isomerase-hydratase-dehydrogenase enzyme and mitochondrial 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase in rat liver. These similarities also appeared at the level of predicted secondary structural elements, suggesting that hte rat multifunctional enzyme has both the isomerization and hydration activities in the amino-terminal domain. This idea is further supported by the proposed existence of only one CoA-binding site in the amino-terminal half of the multifunctional enzyme and by previous studies suggesting that the transfer of the substrate from the isomerization site to the hydration site occurs without aqueous bulk phase (Palosaari P.M., and Hiltunen, J.

After transport, the signal peptide is cleaved by a processing enzyme, signal peptidase I. A comparison of the cleavage sites of many exported proteins has identified a conserved feature of small, uncharged amino acids at positions -1 and -3 relative to the cleavage site. To determine experimentally the sequences required for efficient signal peptide cleavage, we simultaneously randomized the amino acid residues from positions -4 to +2 of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase enzyme to form a library of random sequences. Mutants that provide wild-type levels of ampicillin resistance were then selected from the random-sequence library. The sequences of 15 mutants indicated a bias towards small amino acids. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme was determined for nine of the mutants to assign the new -1 and -3 residues. Alanine was present in the -1 position for all nine of these mutants, strongly supporting the importance of alanine at the -1 position. The amino acids at the -3 position were much less conserved but were consistent with the -3 rules derived from sequence comparisons. Compared with the wild type, two of the nine mutants have an altered cleavage position, suggesting that sequence is more important than position for processing of the signal peptide.},

	abstract = {Rotavirus infection has been proposed to enhance progression towards type 1 diabetes in at-risk children. Rhesus monkey rotavirus (RRV) accelerates diabetes onset in non-obese diabetic (NOD) and T cell receptor transgenic NOD8.3 mice. Infected NOD mice show virus spread to pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), induction of a serum T helper 1-biased specific antibody response and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in PLN and islets. Here, we analysed the effects of RRV infection on intestinal responses and the activation of antigen presenting cells (APC), T cells and B cells in PLN, MLN, spleen and islets. Diabetes acceleration by RRV was associated with minimal immune activation in Peyer's patches. Increased proinflammatory cytokine expression by APC, including dendritic cells, was observed exclusively in the PLN, while cytokine expression by T cells was detected in islets, PLN, MLN and spleen. RRV infection of NOD8.3 mice increased IFNgamma expression by CD8(+) T cells, which primarily recognise an islet autoantigen. A peptide corresponding to RRV VP7 amino acids 5-13, with sequence similarity to this islet autoantigen, did not induce activation or proliferation of NOD8.3 mouse T cells. RRV infection of NOD mice elevated B cell MHC I expression in PLN and MLN, and increased the B cell-mediated proliferation of islet antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. These studies demonstrate that RRV infection of NOD mice activates APC, T cells and B cells at sites where autoreactive lymphocytes accumulate, in association with proinflammatory cytokine expression and an increased capacity to present antigen. Taken together with previous findings, these data support a possible role for bystander activation in type 1 diabetes acceleration by RRV.},

The levels of residual r-proteins in the coproduct, distillers dry grains with solubles (DDGS), were determined. Transgenic corn lines containing recombinant green fluorescence protein (r-GFP) and a recombinant subunit vaccine of Escherichia coli enterotoxin (r-LTB), primarily expressed in endosperm, and another two corn lines containing recombinant human collagen (r-CIalpha1) and r-GFP, primarily expressed in germ, were used as model systems. The kernels were either ground and used for fermentation or dry fractionated to recover germ-rich fractions prior to grinding for fermentation. The finished beers of whole ground kernels and r-protein-spent endosperm solids contained 127-139 and 138-155 g/L ethanol concentrations, respectively. The ethanol levels did not differ among transgenic and normal corn feedstocks, indicating the residual r-proteins did not negatively affect ethanol production. r-Protein extraction and germ removal also did not negatively affect fermentation of the remaining mass. Most r-proteins were inactivated during the mashing process used to prepare corn for fermentation. No functionally active r-GFP or r-LTB proteins were found after fermentation of the r-protein-spent solids; however, a small quantity of residual r-CIalpha1 was detected in DDGS, indicating that the safety of DDGS produced from transgenic grain for r-protein production needs to be evaluated for each event. Protease treatment during fermentation completely hydrolyzed the residual r-CIalpha1, and no residual r-proteins were detectable in DDGS.},

In addition to the negative feedback regulation of p38-p53 signaling, PPM1D inhibits other tumor suppressor activities and is involved in the control of DNA damage and repair pathways. To elucidate the functional significance of PPM1D in breast cancer, we employed RNA interference to downregulate PPM1D expression in BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines and then investigated the effects of PPM1D silencing on global gene expression patterns and signaling pathways using oligonucleotide microarrays. We identified 1798 differentially expressed (at least a two-fold change) gene elements with functions related to key cellular processes, such as regulation of cell cycle, assembly of various intracellular structures and components, and regulation of signaling pathways and metabolic cascades. For instance, genes involved in apoptosis (NR4A1, RAB25, PLK1), formation of nucleosome structure (HIST1H2AC, HIST1H2BF, HIST1H2BO, HIST1H1D), and hormone related activities (NR4A1, ESR1, STC1) were among the differentially expressed genes. Overall, our findings suggest that PPM1D contributes to breast cancer associated phenotypic characteristics by directly or indirectly affecting several important cellular signaling pathways.},

	abstract = {Signal peptides are a cornerstone mechanism for cellular protein localization, yet until now experimental determination of signal peptides has come from only a narrow taxonomic sampling. As a result, the dominant view is that Sec-cleaved signal peptides in prokaryotes are defined by a canonical AxA motif. Although other residues are permitted in the motif, alanine is by far the most common. Here we broadly examine proteomics data to reveal the signal peptide sequences for 32 bacterial and archaeal organisms from nine phyla and demonstrate that this alanine preference is not universal. Discoveries include fundamentally distinct signal peptide motifs from Alphaproteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Thermotogae and Euryarchaeota. In these novel motifs, alanine is no longer the dominant residue but has been replaced in a different way for each taxon. Surprisingly, divergent motifs correlate with a proteome-wide reduction in alanine. Computational analyses of 1,500 genomes reveal numerous major evolutionary clades which have replaced the canonical signal peptide sequence with novel motifs.

Immunodeficiency patients have increased susceptibility to recurrent and persistent, even life-threatening infections. Mutations in a large number of genes can cause defects in different cellular functions and lead to impaired immune response. To date, approximately 150 IDs and more than 100 affected genes have been identified. ID-related genes are distributed throughout the genome, and diseases can be inherited in an X-linked, an autosomal recessive, or an autosomal dominant way. We have collected ID mutation data into locus-specific patient-related mutation databases, IDbases (http://bioinf.uta.fi/IDbases). Mutations are described at DNA, mRNA, and protein levels with links to reference sequences and reference articles. The mutation data has been collated into entries along with some clinical information. IDbases offer an easy way, e.g., to find recently identified mutations, to reveal genotype-phenotype correlations, and to discover a specific mutation or to examine the most common mutations in a single immunodeficiency related gene. At the moment we have databases for 107 ID genes with 4,140 public patient entries. An exhaustive statistical analysis of mutation data from the IDbases was made. Missense and nonsense mutations are the most common mutation types, and the most common single substitution is a nonsense mutation from tryptophan to a stop codon.

At the structural level AIRE forms homodimers through the NH(2)-terminal domain, and molecular modeling for this domain suggests a four-helix bundle structure. In agreement, we show that the common transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) interacts with AIRE in vitro and in yeast nuclei through the CH1 and CH3 conserved domains. We suggest that the transcriptional transactivation properties of AIRE together with its interaction with CBP might be important in its function as disease-causing mutations almost totally abolish the activation effect.},

	abstract = {Diapausing embryos of Austrofundulus limnaeus survive desiccating conditions by reducing evaporative water loss. Over 40\% of diapause II embryos survive 113 days of exposure to 75.5\% relative humidity. An early loss of water from the perivitelline space occurs during days 1-2, but thereafter, rates of water loss are reduced to near zero. No dehydration of the embryonic tissue is indicated based on microscopic observations and the retention of bulk (freezable) water in embryos as judged by differential scanning calorimetry. Such high resistance to desiccation is unprecedented among aquatic vertebrates. Infrared spectroscopy indicates frequent intermolecular contacts via beta-sheet (14\%) in hydrated egg envelopes (chorions). These beta-sheet contacts increase to 36\% on dehydration of the egg envelope. Interestingly, the egg envelope is composed of protein fibrils with characteristics of amyloid fibrils usually associated with human disease. These features include a high proportion of intermolecular beta-sheet, positive staining and green birefringence with Congo red, and detection of long, unbranched fibrils with a diameter of 4-6 nm. The high resistance of diapause II embryos to water stress is not correlated with ontogenetic changes in the egg envelope.},

	abstract = {Newly released human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles obligatorily undergo a maturation process to become infectious. The HIV-1 protease (PR) initiates this step, catalyzing the cleavage of the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol structural polyproteins. Proper organization of the mature virus core requires that cleavage of these polyprotein substrates proceeds in a highly regulated, specific series of events. The vital role the HIV-1 PR plays in the viral life cycle has made it an extremely attractive target for inhibition and has accordingly fostered the development of a number of highly potent substrate-analog inhibitors. Though the PR inhibitors (PIs) inhibit only the HIV-1 PR, their effects manifest at multiple different stages in the life cycle due to the critical importance of the PR in preparing the virus for these subsequent events. Effectively, PIs masquerade as entry inhibitors, reverse transcription inhibitors, and potentially even inhibitors of post-reverse transcription steps. In this chapter, we review the triple threat of PIs: the intermolecular cooperativity in the form of a cooperative dose-response for inhibition in which the apparent potency increases with increasing inhibition; the pleiotropic effects of HIV-1 PR inhibition on entry, reverse transcription, and post-reverse transcription steps; and their potency as transition state analogs that have the potential for further improvement that could lead to an inability of the virus to evolve resistance in the context of single drug therapy.},

Bacteriophage Mu in vitro DNA transposition was used to generate an extensive library of pentapeptide insertion mutants within the alpha-complementing domain 1 of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, yielding mutants at 100\% efficiency. Each mutant contained an accurate 15-bp insertion that translated to five additional amino acids within the protein, and the insertions were distributed essentially randomly along the target sequence. Individual mutants (alpha-donors) were analyzed for their ability to restore (by alpha-complementation) beta-galactosidase activity of the M15 deletion mutant (alpha-acceptor), and the data were correlated to the structure of the beta-galactosidase tetramer. Most of the insertions were well tolerated, including many of those disrupting secondary structural elements even within the protein's interior. Nevertheless, certain sites were sensitive to mutations, indicating both known and previously unknown regions of functional importance. Inhibitory insertions within the N-terminus and loop regions most likely influenced protein tetramerization via direct local effects on protein-protein interactions. Within the domain 1 core, the insertions probably caused either lateral shifting of the polypeptide chain toward the protein's exterior or produced more pronounced structural distortions. Six percent of the mutant proteins exhibited temperature sensitivity, in general suggesting the method's usefulness for generation of conditional phenotypes. The method should be applicable to any cloned protein-encoding gene.},

The statistical distribution of the following properties was studied hydrophobicity, Mr, bulkiness, chromatographic index and preference for adopting alpha-helical, beta-sheet and turn structures. The contribution of each property to the sequence arrangement was derived. A hydrophobic core sequence was found in all signal peptides investigated. The structural arrangement of the cleavage site was also clearly revealed by this study. Most of the physical properties of the individual sequences correlated (correlation coefficient approximately 0.4) very well with the average distribution. The preferred occupancy of amino acid residues in the signal and nascent sequences was also calculated and correlated with their property distribution. The periodic behaviour of the signal and nascent chains was revealed by calculating their hydrophobic moments for various repetitive conformations. A graphical analysis of average hydrophobic moments versus average hydrophobicity of peptides revealed the transmembrane characteristics of signal peptides and globular characteristics of the nascent peptides.},

	abstract = {A significant fraction of HER2+ patients develop resistance to available therapies such as trastuzumab. The acquired resistance is primarily due to hyper activation of HER2 downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Hence, identification of inhibitors of components of this pathway, particularly mTOR, is an area of intense investigation. Interestingly, mTOR specific inhibitors (rapamycin/rapalogs) have been tested and shown to potentiate the effect of HER2 inhibitors. However, the use of mTOR inhibitors will also be associated with the limitations inherently linked with extensive use of anticancer drugs e.g., toxicity and acquired drug resistance. Hereby, we hypothesize development of an alternative novel molecular therapeutic intervention based on cell penetrating peptide (CPP), a highly efficient carrier, conjugated to zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), a precise molecular scissor. The use of HER2 specific CPP conjugated to mTOR specific ZFN, will make the mTOR locus non-functional and inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, essential for growth and proliferation of cancerous cells. With the availability of HER21 cancerous cell specific CPP and proved applications of ZFN in targeted genome engineering of over 11 species, the prospects of success of CPP-ZFN anti-cancer therapy are very high.},

However, proton magnetic resonance studies at high dilution in deuteriated solvents show that N-methylformamide exists as the cis isomer to the extent of 8\% in water, 10.3\% in chloroform, 8.8\% in benzene, and 9.2\% in cyclohexane. Integrated intensities of proton and carbon resonances show that N-methylacetamide exists as the cis isomer to the extent of only 1.5\% in water, not changing much in nonpolar solvents. Quantum mechanical calculations using the 6-31G basis set reproduce these relative abundances with reasonable accuracy and show that there is little difference between the dipole moments of the cis and trans isomers, for either amide. The remarkable insensitivity of cis/trans equilibria to the solvent environment and the heavy preponderance of trans isomers regardless of the polarity of the surroundings (ca. 98.5\% for N-methylacetamide, whose properties may resemble those of a typical peptide bond) accord with the overwhelming preference of peptide bonds for the trans configuration that is consistently observed in the three-dimensional structures of globular proteins.},

It catalyzes DNA cleavage and joining reactions via an initial assembly and subsequent structural transitions of a protein-DNA complex, known as the Mu transpososome, ultimately attaching transposon DNA to non-specific target DNA. The transpososome functions as a molecular DNA-modifying machine and has been used in a wide variety of molecular biology and genetics/genomics applications. To analyze structure-function relationships in MuA action, a comprehensive pentapeptide insertion mutagenesis was carried out for the protein. A total of 233 unique insertion variants were generated, and their activity was analyzed using a quantitative in vivo DNA transposition assay. The results were then correlated with the known MuA structures, and the data were evaluated with regard to the protein domain function and transpososome development. To complement the analysis with an evolutionary component, a protein sequence alignment was produced for 44 members of MuA family transposases. Altogether, the results pinpointed those regions, in which insertions can be tolerated, and those where insertions are harmful. Most insertions within the subdomains Igamma, IIalpha, IIbeta, and IIIalpha completely destroyed the transposase function, yet insertions into certain loop/linker regions of these subdomains increased the protein activity. Subdomains Ialpha and IIIbeta were largely insertion-tolerant. The comprehensive structure-function data set will be useful for designing MuA transposase variants with improved properties for biotechnology/genomics applications, and is informative with regard to the function of RISF proteins in general.},

In this paper we expand upon this work by making use of the more powerful class of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Our model, Philius, is inspired by a previously published HMM, Phobius, and combines a signal peptide submodel with a transmembrane submodel. We introduce a two-stage DBN decoder that combines the power of posterior decoding with the grammar constraints of Viterbi-style decoding. Philius also provides protein type, segment, and topology confidence metrics to aid in the interpretation of the predictions. We report a relative improvement of 13\% over Phobius in full-topology prediction accuracy on transmembrane proteins, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 in detecting signal peptides. We also show that our confidence metrics correlate well with the observed precision. In addition, we have made predictions on all 6.3 million proteins in the Yeast Resource Center (YRC) database. This large-scale study provides an overall picture of the relative numbers of proteins that include a signal-peptide and/or one or more transmembrane segments as well as a valuable resource for the scientific community.

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Several papers have been published where nonlinear machine learning algorithms, e.g. artificial neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees, have been used to model the specificity of the HIV-1 protease and extract specificity rules. We show that the dataset used in these studies is linearly separable and that it is a misuse of nonlinear classifiers to apply them to this problem. The best solution on this dataset is achieved using a linear classifier like the simple perceptron or the linear support vector machine, and it is straightforward to extract rules from these linear models. We identify key residues in peptides that are efficiently cleaved by the HIV-1 protease and list the most prominent rules, relating them to experimental results for the HIV-1 protease. MOTIVATION: Understanding HIV-1 protease specificity is important when designing HIV inhibitors and several different machine learning algorithms have been applied to the problem. However, little progress has been made in understanding the specificity because nonlinear and overly complex models have been used. RESULTS: We show that the problem is much easier than what has previously been reported and that linear classifiers like the simple perceptron or linear support vector machines are at least as good predictors as nonlinear algorithms. We also show how sets of specificity rules can be generated from the resulting linear classifiers. AVAILABILITY: The datasets used are available at http://www.hh.se/staff/bioinf/},

	title = {Structural basis of {Bloom} syndrome ({BS}) causing mutations in the {BLM} helicase domain},
	volume = {6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bloom syndrome (BS) is characterized by mutations within the BLM gene. The Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) has similarity to the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicases, which contain seven conserved helicase domains and share significant sequence and structural similarity with the Rep and PcrA DNA helicases. We modeled the three-dimensional structure of the BLM helicase domain to analyze the structural basis of BS-causing mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sequence alignment was performed for RecQ DNA helicases and Rep and PcrA helicases. The crystal structure of PcrA helicase (PDB entry 3PJR) was used as the template for modeling the BLM helicase domain. The model was used to infer the function of BLM and to analyze the effect of the mutations. RESULTS: The structural model with good stereochemistry of the BLM helicase domain contains two subdomains, 1A and 2A. The electrostatic potential of the model is highly negative over most of the surface, except for the cleft between subdomains 1A and 2A which is similar to the template protein. The ATP-binding site is located inside the model between subdomains 1A and 2A; whereas, the DNA-binding region is situated at the surface cleft, with positive potential between 1A and 2A. CONCLUSIONS: The three-dimensional structure of the BLM helicase domain was modeled and applied to interpret BS-causing mutations. The mutation I841T is likely to weaken DNA binding, while the mutations C891R, C901Y, and Q672R presumably disturb the ATP binding. In addition, other critical positions are discussed.},

The N-terminus of the cytoplasmic WAS protein (WASP) has similarity to WH1 domains, which recognize proline-rich sequences and direct protein localization and formation of multicomponent assemblies. About one-half of the WAS-causing mutations affect the WH1 domain, but this forms only about one-fifth of the length of the protein. To understand the structural and functional effects of WAS-causing mutations within the WH1 domain, the three-dimensional model of the WASP WH1 domain was constructed based on the crystal structures of the Mena and Ev1 EVH1 (WH1) domains. Based on the model, the protein structural effects of the mutations were evaluated and putative ligand-binding regions identified. Mutations in the WASP WH1 domain were found to influence both the function and structure of the WASP. The amino acid substitutions cause general and local structural changes because of steric clashes and changes to the positions of adjacent strands and the fold of the protein. Some mutations alter the electrostatics and interactions with partners and other domains of WASP.},

Because it can be used to make measurements at night, the system has a significant advantage for measuring polar constituents in winter, when conditions that might give rise to ozone loss are initiated. Other advantages arise from the use of a cooled two-dimensional CCD array as the detector: an array detector avoids spectral noise resulting from scintillation of stars or from clouds passing overhead and allows for the possibility of measuring several constituents simultaneously; its second dimension permits auroral light from the atmosphere adjacent to the star to be measured simultaneously and subtracted from the stellar light, and a modern low-noise CCD allows us to use a telescope of modest diameter. The few previous measurements of constituents made by the use of stellar absorption did not have these advantages. The instrument was configured for simplicity and ease of use in field measurements and was deployed outside in winter in Northern Sweden in 1991. Examples of ozone measurements are shown.},

	volume = {3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene has been shown to be mutated in the human immunodeficiency disease, XLA (X-linked agammaglobulinemia). Btk is a member of the Tec family of cytosolic protein tyrosine kinases with distinct functional domains PH, TH, SH3, SH2, and kinase. Mutations have been observed in each of the Btk subdomains in XLA. We have analyzed the Btk gene in six XLA patients from five unrelated families. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was prepared from the patients peripheral blood. The Btk exons including the junctional sequences were analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by direct nucleotide sequencing after PCR-amplification. For structural analysis, the missense mutations were introduced into three-dimensional models of the PH and kinase domains of Btk and the outcome was predicted based on the knowledge of the protein function. RESULTS: Five novel mutations and two novel polymorphisms, all of which resulted from single-base alterations, were identified. Three of the five mutations were in the PH domain and two were in the kinase domain of Btk. Three of these mutations were of the missense type, two of which altered the same codon in the PH domain; the third one was located in the kinase domain. The fourth mutation was a point deletion in the PH domain causing a frameshift followed by premature termination. The fifth mutation was a splice donor-site mutation within the kinase domain which could result in an exon skipping. In four of the five instances, mothers of the patients were shown to be obligate carriers. In one instance, a sibling sister was identified as a heterozygote establishing her as a carrier. CONCLUSIONS: Functional consequences of the mutations causing frameshifts and altered splicing can be inferred directly. Functional consequences of the missense mutations were interpreted by 3-dimensional structural modeling of Btk domains. It is proposed that the two PH domain mutations will interfere with membrane localization while the kinase domain mutation will interfere with the enzymatic function of Btk. This study provides further insight into the role of Btk in XLA.},

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Jak tyrosine kinases have a unique domain structure containing a kinase domain (JH1) adjacent to a catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain (JH2). JH2 is crucial for inhibition of basal Jak activity, but the mechanism of this regulation has remained elusive. We show that JH2 negatively regulated Jak2 in bacterial cells, indicating that regulation is an intrinsic property of Jak2. JH2 suppressed basal Jak2 activity by lowering the V(max) of Jak2, whereas JH2 did not affect the K(m) of Jak2 for a peptide substrate. Three inhibitory regions (IR1-3) within JH2 were identified. IR3 (residues 758-807), at the C terminus of JH2, directly inhibited JH1, suggesting an inhibitory interaction between IR3 and JH1. Molecular modeling of JH2 showed that IR3 could form a stable alpha-helical fold, supporting that IR3 could independently inhibit JH1. IR2 (725-757) in the C-terminal lobe of JH2, and IR1 (619-670), extending from the N-terminal to the C-terminal lobe, enhanced IR3-mediated inhibition of JH1. Disruption of IR3 either by mutations or a small deletion increased basal Jak2 activity, but abolished interferon-gamma-inducible signaling. Together, the results provide evidence for autoinhibition of a Jak family kinase and identify JH2 regions important for autoregulation of Jak2.},

	abstract = {Early diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can improve long-term prognosis. MTC can be detected at an early stage by calcitonin screening in all patients with thyroid nodules. This approach, however, is controversial due to high costs and a limited specificity of calcitonin. It was the aim of the present study to investigate whether ultrasonography may contribute to the diagnosis of MTC in patients with thyroid nodules. The study included 19 patients with newly diagnosed MTC. Ten patients had sporadic MTC, 7 had multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A, and 2 patients had MEN 2B. In all subjects conventional ultrasound, and in 14 patients color Doppler sonography were performed before primary surgery. For comparison, ultrasound appearance of 139 benign thyroid nodules was evaluated. In conventional ultrasound, MTC in 17/19 (89\%) patients were hypoechoic, contained intranodular calcifications, and had no "halo sign". The combination of these criteria were found in only 8/139 (6\%) of benign thyroid nodules. Intranodular blood flow was found in 11/14 patients with MTC (79\%), perinodular blood flow in 7/14 MTC (50\%). In conclusion, conventional ultrasound reveals a combination of hypoechogenicity, intranodular calcifications, and absence of "halo sign" in the vast majority of MTC. Since this sonographic pattern only rarely occurs in benign thyroid nodules, the results indicate that thyroid ultrasound can contribute to the diagnosis of MTC. In addition, the findings may have implications for calcitonin screening in nodular thyroid disease.},

During maturation, B cells progress through a series of developmental stages defined by specific phenotypic surface markers and the rearrangement and expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. To get insight into B cell proteome during the maturation pathway, we studied differential protein expression in eight human cell lines, which cover four distinctive developmental stages; early pre-B, pre-B, plasma cell and immature B cell upon anti-IgM stimulation. Our two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry based proteomic study indicates the involvement of large number of proteins with various functions. Notably, proteins related to cytoskeleton were relatively highly expressed in early pre-B and pre-B cells, whereas plasma cell proteome contained endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi system proteins. Our long time series analysis in anti-IgM stimulated Ramos B cells revealed the dynamic regulation of cytoskeleton organization, gene expression and metabolic pathways, among others. The findings are related to cellular processes in B cells and are discussed in relation to experimental information for the proteins and pathways they are involved in.

We investigated the proteome profiles of stimulated and nonstimulated Ramos B-cells at eight time points during 5 d and compared the obtained proteomic data to the corresponding data from DNA-microarray studies. Anti-mIgM stimulation of the cells resulted in significant differences ({\textgreater} or =twofold) in the protein abundance close to 100 proteins and differences in post-translational protein modifications. Forty-eight up- or down-regulated proteins were identified by mass spectrometric methods and database searches. The identities of a further nine proteins were revealed by comparing their positions to the known proteins in other lymphocyte 2-DE databases. Several of the proteins are directly related to the functional and morphological characteristics of B-cells, such as cytoskeleton rearrangement and intracellular signalling triggered by the crosslinking of B-cell receptors. In addition to proteins known to be involved in human B-cell maturation, we identified several proteins that were not previously linked to lymphocyte differentiation. The results provide deeper insights into the process of B-cell maturation and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for immunodeficiencies.

More than 200 PIDs affecting components of the innate and adaptive immune systems have been described. Clinical, pathological, and laboratory characteristics were collected and used to group PIDs. A consensus of at least five independent methods provided a novel classification of 11 groups, which revealed previously unknown features and relationships of PIDs.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ImmunoDeficiency Resource (IDR) is a knowledge base for the integration of the clinical, biochemical, genetic, genomic, proteomic, structural, and computational data of primary immunodeficiencies. The need for the IDR arises from the lack of structured and systematic information about primary immunodeficiencies on the Internet, and from the lack of a common platform which enables doctors, researchers, students, nurses and patients to find out validated information about these diseases. DESCRIPTION: The IDR knowledge base, first released in 1999, has grown substantially. It contains information for 158 diseases, both from a clinical as well as molecular point of view. The database and the user interface have been reformatted. This new IDR release has a richer and more complete breadth, depth and scope. The service provides the most complete and up-to-date dataset. The IDR has been integrated with several internal and external databases and services. The contents of the IDR are validated and selected for different types of users (doctors, nurses, researchers and students, as well as patients and their families). The search engine has been improved and allows either a detailed or a broad search from a simple user interface. CONCLUSION: The IDR is the first knowledge base specifically designed to capture in a systematic and validated way both clinical and molecular information for primary immunodeficiencies. The service is freely available at http://bioinf.uta.fi/idr and is regularly updated. The IDR facilitates primary immunodeficiencies informatics and helps to parameterise in silico modelling of these diseases. The IDR is useful also as an advanced education tool for medical students, and physicians.},

The information available from the Internet for over 200 PIDs is scattered between numerous services and databases. Patient information has been collected in different patient registries. Several software tools have been developed in order to build the databases, expert systems and other information systems useful in diagnosis or prediction. RECENT FINDINGS: Previously released services have been significantly improved and some new bioinformatics tools have been developed to help in diagnosis, prediction, mutation analysis and classification of PIDs. Several national initiatives have been launched for centralized PID information services. The very latest additions are tools and approaches for PID candidate gene prioritization, systematic classification and a medical expert system to help in diagnosis. SUMMARY: Many bioinformatics tools for PIDs are already freely available over the Internet. We expect bioinformatics tools to further help healthcare professionals in diagnosis, analysis and prediction. Currently, most of the resources are stand-alone and thus their integration will be a challenge for the future. Another challenge is to develop terminologies, ontologies and standards to achieve semantic interoperability.},

A common criticism against such neural network models is that it is difficult to interpret the criteria that are used in making predictions. We address this concern with several new prediction methods that base predictions explicitly on the abundance of different amino acid types in the N-terminal region of the protein. Our successful prediction accuracy suggests that ChloroP uses little positional information in its decision-making; an unexpected result given the elaborate ChloroP input scheme. By removing positional information, our simpler methods allow us to identify those amino acids that are useful for successful prediction. The identification of important sequence features, such as amino acid content, is advantageous if one of the goals of localization predictors is to gain an understanding of the biological process of chloroplast localization. Our most accurate predictor combines principal component analysis and logistic regression. Web-based prediction using this method is available online at http://apicoplast.cis.upenn.edu/pclr/.},

The rarely available patient biopsies show lamellar inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum. We studied the pathogenesis of these chondrodysplasias by expressing several disease-causing COMP mutations in bovine primary chondrocytes and found that COMP-associated chondrodysplasias are not exclusively storage diseases. Although COMP carrying the mutations D469Delta and D475N was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum, secretion of COMP H587R was only slightly retarded. All pseudoachondroplasia mutations impair cellular viability and cause a disruption of the extracellular matrix formed in alginate culture irrespective of the degree of cellular retention. The mutation D361Y associated with the clinically milder disease multiple epiphyseal dysplasia gave mild retention and limited matrix alterations, but the transfected cells showed normal viability. The effect of mutated COMP on matrix formation and cell-matrix interaction may be a major element in the pathogenesis of COMP-associated chondrodysplasias.},

	volume = {103},
	abstract = {Phosphodiester linkages, including those that join the nucleotides of DNA, are highly resistant to spontaneous hydrolysis. The rate of water attack at the phosphorus atom of phosphodiesters is known only as an upper limit, based on the hydrolysis of the dimethyl phosphate anion. That reaction was found to proceed at least 99\% by C-O cleavage, at a rate suggesting an upper limit of 10(-15) s(-1) for P-O cleavage of phosphodiester anions at 25 degrees C. To evaluate the rate enhancement produced by P-O cleaving phosphodiesterases such as staphylococcal nuclease, we decided to establish the actual value of the rate constant for P-O cleavage of a simple phosphodiester anion. In dineopentyl phosphate, C-O cleavage is sterically precluded so that hydrolysis occurs only by P-O cleavage. Measurements at elevated temperatures indicate that the dineopentyl phosphate anion undergoes hydrolysis in water with a t(1/2) of 30,000,000 years at 25 degrees C, furnishing an indication of the resistance of the internucleotide linkages of DNA to water attack at phosphorus. These results imply that staphylococcal nuclease (k(cat) = 95 s(-1)) enhances the rate of phosphodiester hydrolysis by a factor of approximately 10(17). In alkaline solution, thymidylyl-3'-5'-thymidine (TpT) has been reported to decompose 10(5)-fold more rapidly than does dineopentyl phosphate. We find however that TpT and thymidine decompose at similar rates and with similar activation parameters, to a similar set of products, at pH 7 and in 1 M KOH. We infer that the decomposition of TpT is initiated by the breakdown of thymidine, not by phosphodiester hydrolysis.},

	abstract = {As a model for mechanistic comparison with peptidyl transfer within the ribosome, the reaction of aqueous glycinamide with N-formylphenylalanine trifluoroethyl ester (fPhe-TFE) represents an improvement over earlier model reactions involving Tris. The acidity of trifluoroethanol (pKa 12.4) resembles that of tRNA (12.98) more closely than do the acidities of model reactants described earlier, and the reactivity of the simple nucleophile glycinamide is free of potential complications that arise from alternative reaction pathways available to Tris. At 25 degrees C, the uncatalyzed reaction of glycinamide with fPhe-TFE proceeds with a second-order rate constant of 3 x 10(-5) M-1 s-1; DeltaH(++) = +7.8 kcal/mol; TDeltaS(++)= -15.7 kcal/mol. The ribosomal reaction of puromycin with fMet-tRNA proceeds 3 x 107-fold more rapidly, with a second-order rate constant (kcat/Km) of 1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1; DeltaH(++) = +16.0 kcal/mol; TDeltaS(++)= +2.0 kcal/mol. That rate enhancement, an order of magnitude larger than estimated earlier, is fully explained by the more favorable entropy of activation of the ribosomal reaction. Experiments involving ethylene glycol esters suggest that neighboring -OH group effects are negligible in the presence of solvent water, which itself acts as a general base catalyst. In the desolvated interior of the ribosome, the vicinal 2'-OH group of aminoacyl-tRNA probably replaces water as a general base catalyst. But the catalytic effect of the ribosome itself is overwhelmingly entropic in origin, suggesting that the ribosome achieves its effect by physical desolvation and/or juxtaposition of the reactants in a manner conducive to peptidyl transfer.},

Rates of deamination of 2'-deoxycytidine, 1-methylcytosine, and cytidine were found to be identical within experimental error (t1/2 approximately 20 years, 37 degrees C). Rate constants for deamination of 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine, which could not be determined directly because of rapid glycoside cleavage, were estimated by assuming that methyl replacement should generate reasonable model substrates. The rates of deamination of 9-methyladenine and 9-methylguanine were found to be similar to each other (t1/2 approximately 6000 years, 37 degrees C) and approximately 10(2)-fold slower than the rates of glycoside cleavage in 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine. The deamination of 2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, and 2'-deoxycytidine led to accelerated rates of glycoside cleavage. In the exceptional case of 2'-deoxycytidine, deamination and glycoside hydrolysis proceed at very similar rates at all temperatures. Glycoside cleavage proceeds with half-times ranging from 4 years for 2'-deoxyinosine to 40 years for 2'-deoxycytidine (37 degrees C). The rate enhancements produced by DNA glycosylases, estimated by comparison with the rates of these uncatalyzed reactions, are found to be substantially smaller than those produced by deaminases and staphylococcal nuclease.},

	volume = {51},
	abstract = {Cytidine deaminase (CDA) binds the inhibitor zebularine as its 3,4-hydrate (K(d) 10(-12) M), capturing all but 5.6 kcal/mol of the free energy of binding expected of an ideal transition state analogue (K(tx) 10(-16) M). On the basis of its entropic origin, that shortfall was tentatively ascribed to the trapping of a water molecule in the enzyme-inhibitor complex, as had been observed earlier for product uridine [Snider, M. J., and Wolfenden, R. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 11364-11371]. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) of CDA nebularized in the presence of saturating 5-fluorozebularine reveals peaks corresponding to the masses of E(2)Zn(2)W(2) (dimeric Zn-CDA with two water molecules), E(2)Zn(2)W(2)Fz, and E(2)Zn(2)W(2)Fz(2), where Fz represents the 3,4-hydrate of 5-fluorozebularine. In the absence of an inhibitor, E(2)Zn(2) is the only dimeric species detected, with no additional water molecules. Experiments conducted in H(2)(18)O indicate that the added mass W represents a trapped water molecule rather than an isobaric ammonium ion. This appears to represent the first identification of an enzyme-bound water molecule at a subunit interface (active site) using FTICR-MS. The presence of a 5-fluoro group appears to retard the decomposition of the inhibitory complex kinetically in the vapor phase, as no additional dimeric complexes (other than E(2)Zn(2)) are observed when zebularine is used in place of 5-fluorozebularine. Substrate competition assays show that in solution zebularine is released from CDA (k(off) {\textgreater} 0.14 s(-1)) much more rapidly than is 5-fluorozebularine (k(off) = 0.014 s(-1)), despite the greater thermodynamic stability of the zebularine complex.},

A crucial difference, however, between these filters and our implementation is that our fully automated smoothing filter requires no parameter specification or parameter optimization. Results are comparable to, or better than, Savitzky-Golay filters with optimized parameters and superior to the automated iterative median filter.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cells react to changing intra- and extracellular signals by dynamically modulating complex biochemical networks. Cellular responses to extracellular signals lead to changes in gene and protein expression. Since the majority of genes encode proteins, we investigated possible correlations between protein parameters and gene expression patterns to identify proteome-wide characteristics indicative of trends common to expressed proteins. RESULTS: Numerous bioinformatics methods were used to filter and merge information regarding gene and protein annotations. A new statistical time point-oriented analysis was developed for the study of dynamic correlations in large time series data. The method was applied to investigate microarray datasets for different cell types, organisms and processes, including human B and T cell stimulation, Drosophila melanogaster life span, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. CONCLUSION: We show that the properties of proteins synthesized correlate dynamically with the gene expression profile, indicating that not only is the actual identity and function of expressed proteins important for cellular responses but that several physicochemical and other protein properties correlate with gene expression as well. Gene expression correlates strongly with amino acid composition, composition- and sequence-derived variables, functional, structural, localization and gene ontology parameters. Thus, our results suggest that a dynamic relationship exists between proteome properties and gene expression in many biological systems, and therefore this relationship is fundamental to understanding cellular mechanisms in health and disease.},

	abstract = {A huge quantity of gene and protein sequences have become available during the post-genomic era, and information about genetic variations, including amino acid substitutions and SNPs, is accumulating rapidly. To understand the effects of these changes, it is often essential to apply bioinformatics tools. Where there is a lack of homologous sequences or a three-dimensional structure, it becomes essential to predict the effects of mutations based solely on protein sequence information. Several computational methods utilizing machine learning techniques have been developed. These predictions generally use the 20-alphabet amino acid code to train the model. With limited available data, the 20-alphabet amino acid features may introduce so many parameters that the model becomes over-fitted. To decrease the number of parameters, we propose a physicochemical feature-based method to forecast the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein stability. Protein structure alterations caused by mutations can be classified as stabilizing or destabilizing. Based on experimental folding-unfolding free energy (DeltaDeltaG) values, we trained a support vector machine with a cleaned data set. The physicochemical properties of the mutated residues, the number of neighboring residues in the primary sequence and the temperature and pH were used as input attributes. Different kernel functions, attributes and window sizes were optimized. An average accuracy of 80\% was obtained in cross-validation experiments.},

The diversity of the distribution of amino acids was measured by calculating entropies for sequences containing mutations at different positions in multiple sequence alignments. Mutual information was calculated to quantify positional covariation. Eight conserved extrema were apparent in all profiles. The majority of the XLA disease-causing mutations in the Btk PH domain were found at positions having significant mutual information, indicating that there are covariant constraints for both structure and function.

	volume = {33},
	abstract = {With the avalanche of newly-found protein sequences emerging in the post genomic era, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method for fast and reliably identifying their subcellular locations because knowledge thus obtained can provide key clues for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. However, predicting subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins is a challenging problem, particularly when unknown query proteins do not have significant homology to proteins of known subcellular locations and when more locations need to be covered. To cope with the challenge, protein samples are formulated by hybridizing the information derived from the gene ontology database and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition. Based on such a representation, a novel ensemble hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. Each of these basic classifiers was engineered by the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) principle. As a demonstration, a new benchmark dataset was constructed that covers the following 18 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole, (3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7) endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) hydrogenosome, (11) lysosome, (12) mitochondria, (13) nucleus, (14) peroxisome, (15) plasma membrane, (16) plastid, (17) spindle pole body, and (18) vacuole. To avoid the homology bias, none of the proteins included has {\textgreater} or =25\% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the 5-fold and jackknife cross-validation tests were 81.6 and 80.3\%, respectively, which were 40-50\% higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same strict dataset. The powerful predictor, named "Euk-PLoc", is available as a web-server at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/euk . Furthermore, to support the need of people working in the relevant areas, a downloadable file will be provided at the same website to list the results predicted by Euk-PLoc for all eukaryotic protein entries (excluding fragments) in Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations or are annotated as being uncertain.

	abstract = {Functioning as an "address tag" that directs nascent proteins to their proper cellular and extracellular locations, signal peptides have become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells for gene therapy. To effectively and timely use such a tool, however, the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant, animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences, respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-3L that consists of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing many individual OET-KNN (optimized evidence-theoretic K nearest neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of PseAA (pseudo amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set of candidates for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a query secretory protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm; (3) determining the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence alignment outcome for each of the aforementioned candidates through a voting system. Signal-3L is featured by high success prediction rates with short computational time, and hence is particularly useful for the analysis of large-scale datasets. Signal-3L is freely available as a web-server at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Signal-3L/ or http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Signal-3L, where, to further support the demand of the related areas, the signal peptides identified by Signal-3L for all the protein entries in Swiss-Prot databank that do not have signal peptide annotations or are annotated with uncertain terms but are classified by Signal-3L as secretory proteins are provided in a downloadable file.

Distribution measurements between neutral aqueous solution and cyclohexane, at varying solute concentrations, showed no evidence of self-association of the solute in either solvent, and the possibility of specific entrainment of water by solutes entering cyclohexane was ruled out by the results of experiments with tritiated water. In both the n-butyl and tetrahydrofuryl series, the bases span a range of approximately 5.3 kcal mol-1 in their free energies of transfer from water to cyclohexane, and are arranged in the following rank, in order of decreasing hydrophobicity: purine{\textgreater}thymine{\textgreater}adenine{\textgreater}uracil{\textgreater}pyrimidin-2-one{\textgreater}hypoxanthine{\textgreater}/=cytosine {\textgreater}/=guanine. In both series of pyrimidin-2-ones, hydrophobicity decreases with introduction of an amino substituent, but addition of an exocyclic keto group results in a modest enhancement of hydrophobicity; and free energies of transfer are relatively insensitive to the position of N-alkyl substitution. In both series of purines, hydrophobicity decreases with the introduction of exocyclic amino and keto groups, the keto group having the greater effect; and free energies of transfer vary substantially depending on the position of N-alkyl substitution. Several additional compounds were examined to test recent predictions based on SM5.4/A, a quantum mechanical self-consistent-field solvation model; and that model was found to yield values in reasonable agreement with the experimental results.},

The equilibrium constant for conversion of ES to ES*, in the oxygen exchange reaction, is less than 10-12. To investigate the structure of enzyme-bound inosine in a different way, we labeled deoxyinosine with 13C, excepting an upfield shift of 70-110 ppm if significant rehybridization to sp3 had occurred at the carbonyl group. Instead, the results show a very small shift (1.3 ppm), indicating that C-6 of 2'-deoxyinosine retains its sp2 hybridization after binding by calf intestinal adenosine deaminase. In a separate series of experiments, [4,5-13C]-2'-deoxyuridine was synthesized and found to retain its sp2 hybridization at C-4, after binding by Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase, an enzyme that catalyzes 18O exchange from water into uridine. These findings are consistent with the general expectation, based on the unfavorable equilibrium of activation of enzyme-bound substrates, that enzymes should not accumulate appreciable concentrations of intermediates whose free energies approach that of the transition state in substrate transformation.},

	abstract = {Increasing sociopolitical concerns with antibiotic use have led to investigations of potential alternatives for food safety and growth promotion. Direct-fed microbials (DFM) including spore-based probiotics are amenable to feed inclusion and are extremely stable. We isolated several Bacillus spp. from environmental and poultry sources and tested them for their ability to reduce Salmonella in vitro. In a preliminary in vivo trial, day-of-hatch chicks and poults were randomly assigned to the following treatments (24 birds/treatment): control and one of 8 DFM candidates at 10(6) spores/g of feed. Chicks and poults were tagged, weighed, and orally challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium (ST). Body weight gain and ST recovery were measured 11 d posthatch. Total percentages of ST-positive crop and ceca were significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.05) in at least 3 DFM candidates compared with control. Additionally, beneficial effects on BW gain were observed in at least 5 DFM candidates (P {\textless} 0.05) compared with control. In a second study, birds treated with NP122 (identified as Bacillus subtilis) had significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.05) cecal ST than control and benefitted BW gain irrespective of the presence or absence of a Salmonella challenge. In conclusion, NP122 markedly reduced ST recovery and increased BW gain in both chicks and poults. This provides preliminary evidence that this isolate may have potential use as a DFM in poultry.},

	abstract = {Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens (CP) in poultry is an important bacterial disease in terms of economic implications. The disease is multifactorial and is invariably associated with predisposing factors. In the present experiments, we investigated the potential predisposing role of neonatal Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) infection for NE-associated mortality in a laboratory challenge model. In two experiments, day-of-hatch chicks were randomly assigned to four groups: Group 1, nonchallenged control; Group 2, chickens received Eimeria maxima (EM) and CP; Group 3, chickens received EM and CP and were also challenged with ST at day 1 of age; Group 4, chickens received EM and CP and were also challenged with ST at day 17 of age. Challenged groups received an oral dose of EM at 18 days of age and CP (10(8) colony-forming units/chick) at 22-23 days of age. When compared to EM and CP, chicks challenged with ST (day 1) had increased NE-associated mortality and CP-associated lesion scores (P {\textless} 0.05) in both experiments. Furthermore, body weight and body weight gain were lower (P {\textless} 0.05) in chicks infected with ST (day 1) in the first experiment, even though no differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) were observed in weight gain in the second experiment. Chicks challenged with ST (day 17) were similar to the EM and CP group in all of the above-mentioned parameters, indicating that a paratyphoid infection in younger chicks remarkably alters the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. Based on this work, the authors suggest that an ST infection early in the age of a chick may be important for altering susceptibility to NE, an observation that may be useful from the perspective of experimental reproduction of this disease and, perhaps, as an economically important reason to address the problem of paratyphoid Salmonella infections in young chicks.},

We found that feedforward perceptron neural networks were appropriate for the prediction of polyproline type II and also relatively efficient in this task.

In contrast with most protein enzymes, the enthalpy of activation is slightly less favorable on the ribosome than in solution. The 2 x 10(7)-fold rate enhancement produced by the ribosome is achieved entirely by lowering the entropy of activation. These results are consistent with the view that the ribosome enhances the rate of peptide bond formation mainly by positioning the substrates and/or water exclusion within the active site, rather than by conventional chemical catalysis.},

We have demonstrated previously that a tyrosine motif in the cytoplasmic domain of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) spike glycoprotein E2 is absolutely essential for budding. In contrast, hardly anything is known regarding which region of the capsid protein is involved in spike binding. Therefore, the mechanism by which spikes are selectively sorted into the viral bud or by which energy is provided for envelopment, remains unclear. RESULTS: Molecular models of the SFV capsid protein (SFCP) and the cytoplasmic domain of the spike protein were fitted as a basis for a reverse genetics approach to characterizing the interaction between these two proteins. Biochemical analysis of mutants defined a hydrophobic pocket of the capsid protein that is involved both in spike binding and nucleocapsid assembly. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that aromatic residues in the capsid protein serve to bind the side chain of the essential E2 tyrosine providing both specificity for spike incorporation and energy for budding. The same hydrophobic pocket also appears to play a role in capsid assembly. Furthermore, the results suggest that budding may occur in the absence of preformed nucleocapsids. This is the first demonstration of the molecular mechanisms of spike-nucleocapsid interactions during virus budding.},

The activity of each mutant enzyme increased in the presence of added zinc but never attained wild-type activity. Mutant H102N was unique in that this protein could be purified as a stable apoenzyme, activated by added zinc, and then inhibited by EDTA. This mutant enzyme bound zinc with an apparent Kd value of 6.0 x 10(-10) M and regained maximal activity in the presence of 1 mol of zinc per subunit. Affinities of the mutant cytidine deaminases for the transition-state analogue, 5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside (3,4) hydrate, were found to decrease in rough proportion to kcat/Km over a range spanning several orders of magnitude.

Since then, additional kinases belonging to this family have been isolated, and the availability of full genome sequences allows identification of all members in selected species enabling phylogenetic considerations. Tec kinases are endowed with Pleckstrin homology (PH) and Tec homology (TH) domains and are involved in diverse biological processes related to the control of survival and differentiation fate. Membrane translocation resulting in the activation of Tec kinases with subsequent Ca2+ release seems to be a general feature. However, nuclear translocation may also be of importance.

	volume = {39},
	abstract = {To obtain a clearer understanding of the forces involved in transition state stabilization by Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase, we investigated the thermodynamic changes that accompany substrate binding in the ground state and transition state for substrate hydrolysis. Viscosity studies indicate that the action of cytidine deaminase is not diffusion-limited. Thus, K(m) appears to be a true dissociation constant, and k(cat) describes the chemical reaction of the ES complex, not product release. Enzyme-substrate association is accompanied by a loss of entropy and a somewhat greater release of enthalpy. As the ES complex proceeds to the transition state (ES), there is little further change in entropy, but heat is taken up that almost matches the heat that was released with ES formation. As a result, k(cat)/K(m) (describing the overall conversion of the free substrate to ES is almost invariant with changing temperature. The free energy barrier for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (k(cat)/K(m)) is much lower than that for the spontaneous reaction (k(non)) (DeltaDeltaG = -21.8 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C). This difference, which also describes the virtual binding affinity of the enzyme for the activated substrate in the transition state (S), is almost entirely enthalpic in origin (DeltaDeltaH = -20.2 kcal/mol), compatible with the formation of hydrogen bonds that stabilize the ES complex. Thus, the transition state affinity of cytidine deaminase increases rapidly with decreasing temperature. When a hydrogen bond between Glu-91 and the 3'-hydroxyl moiety of cytidine is disrupted by truncation of either group, k(cat)/K(m) and transition state affinity are each reduced by a factor of 10(4). This effect of mutation is entirely enthalpic in origin (DeltaDeltaH approximately 7.9 kcal/mol), somewhat offset by a favorable change in the entropy of transition state binding. This increase in entropy is attributed to a loss of constraints on the relative motions of the activated substrate within the ES complex. In an Appendix, some objections to the conventional scheme for transition state binding are discussed.},

	abstract = {In neutral solution, 5,6-dihydrocytidine undergoes spontaneous deamination (k25 approximately 3.2 x 10(-5) s(-1)) much more rapidly than does cytidine (k25 approximately 3.0 x 10(-10) s(-1)), with a more favorable enthalpy of activation (DeltaDeltaH\# = -8.7 kcal/mol) compensated by a less favorable entropy of activation (TDeltaDeltaS\# = -1.8 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C). E. coli cytidine deaminase enhances the rate of deamination of 5,6-dihydrocytidine (kcat/k(non) = 4.4 x 10(5)) by enhancing the entropy of activation (DeltaDeltaH\# = 0 kcal/mol; TDeltaDeltaS\# = +7.6 kcal/mol, at 25 degrees C). Binding of the competitive inhibitor 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine (THU), a stable analogue of 5,6-dihydrocytidine in the transition state for its deamination, is accompanied by a release of enthalpy (DeltaH = -7.1 kcal/mol, TDeltaDeltaS = +2.2 kcal/mol) that approaches the estimated enthalpy of binding of the actual substrate in the transition state for deamination of 5,6-dihydrocytidine (DeltaH = -8.1 kcal/mol, TDeltaDeltaS = +6.0 kcal/mol). Thus, the shortcomings of THU in capturing all of the binding affinity expected of an ideal transition-state analogue reflect a less favorable entropy of association. That difference may arise from the analogue's inability to displace a water molecule from the "leaving group site" at which ammonia is generated in the normal reaction. The effect on binding of removing the 4-OH group from the transition-state analogue THU, to form 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrozebularine (THZ) (DeltaDeltaH = -2.1 kcal/mol, TDeltaDeltaS = -4.4 kcal/mol), is mainly entropic, consistent with the inability of THZ to displace water from the "attacking group site". These results are consistent with earlier indications [Snider, M. J., and Wolfenden, R.

	abstract = {15N isotope effects and solvent deuterium isotope effects have been measured for the hydrolytic deamination of cytidine catalyzed by Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase and for the uncatalyzed reaction proceeding spontaneously in neutral solution at elevated temperatures. The primary (15)(V/K) arising from the exocyclic amino group for wild-type cytidine deaminase acting on its natural substrate, cytidine, is 1.0109 (in H(2)O, pH 7.3), 1.0123 (in H(2)O, pH 4.2), and 1.0086 (in D(2)O, pD 7.3). Increasing solvent D(2)O content has no substantial effect on k(cat) but enhances k(cat)/K(m), with a proton inventory showing that the fractionation factors of at least two protons increase markedly during the reaction. Mutant cytidine deaminases with reduced catalytic activity show more pronounced (15)N isotope effects of 1.0124 (Glu91Ala), 1.0134 (His102Ala), and 1.0158 (His102Asn) at pH 7.3 in H(2)O, as expected for processes in which the chemical transformation of the substrate becomes more rate determining. The isotope effect of mutant His102Asn is 1.033 after correcting for protonation of the -NH(2) group, and represents the intrinsic isotope effect on C-N bond cleavage. This result allows an estimation of the forward commitment of the reaction with the wild-type enzyme. The observed (15)N kinetic isotope effect of the pyrimidine N-3, for wild-type cytidine deaminase acting on cytidine, is 0.9879, which is consistent with protonation and rehybidization of N-3 with hydroxide ion attack on the adjacent carbon to create a tetrahedral intermediate. These results show that enzymatic deamination of cytidine proceeds stepwise through a tetrahedral intermediate with ammonia elimination as the major rate-determining step. The primary (15)N isotope effects observed for the uncatalyzed reaction at pH 7 (1.0021) and pH 12.5 (1.0034) were found to be insensitive to changing temperatures between 100 and 185 degrees C. These results show that the uncatalyzed and the enzymatic deaminations of cytidine proceed by similar mechanisms, although the commitment to C-N bond breaking is greater for the spontaneous reaction.},

In the present work, we determined the thermodynamic changes associated with the equilibrium binding of inhibitors by cytidine deaminase by isothermal titration calorimetry and van't Hoff analysis of the temperature dependence of their inhibition constants. The results indicate that the binding of the transition state analogue 3,4-dihydrouridine DeltaH = -21 kcal/mol), like that of the transition state itself (DeltaH = -20 kcal/mol), is associated with a large favorable change in enthalpy. The significantly smaller enthalpy change that accompanies the binding of 3,4-dihydrozebularine (DeltaH = -10 kcal/mol), an analogue of 3,4-dihydrouridine in which a hydrogen atom replaces this inhibitor's 4-OH group, is consistent with the view that polar interactions with the substrate at the site of its chemical transformation play a critical role in reducing the enthalpy of activation for substrate hydrolysis. The entropic shortcomings of 3,4-dihydrouridine, in capturing all of the free energy involved in binding the actual transition state, may arise from its inability to displace a water molecule that occupies the binding site normally occupied by product ammonia.},

	abstract = {Human malignant infantile osteopetrosis (arOP; MIM 259700) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder of bone metabolism, which, if untreated, has a fatal outcome. Our group, as well as others, have recently identified mutations in the ATP6i (TCIRG1) gene, encoding the a3 subunit of the vacuolar proton pump, which mediates the acidification of the bone/osteoclast interface, are responsible for a subset of this condition. By sequencing the ATP6i gene in arOP patients from 44 unrelated families with a worldwide distribution we have now established that ATP6i mutations are responsible for approximately 50\% of patients affected by this disease. The vast majority of these mutations (40 out of 42 alleles, including seven deletions, two insertions, 10 nonsense substitutions and 21 mutations in splice sites) are predicted to cause severe abnormalities in the protein product and are likely to represent null alleles. In addition, we have also analysed nine unrelated arOP patients from Costa Rica, where this disease is apparently much more frequent than elsewhere. All nine Costa Rican patients bore either or both of two missense mutations (G405R and R444L) in amino acid residues which are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. The identification of ATP6i gene mutations in two families allowed us for the first time to perform prenatal diagnosis: both fetuses were predicted not to be affected and two healthy babies were born. This study contributes to the determination of genetic heterogeneity of arOP and allows further delineation of the other genetic defects causing this severe condition.},

Mutations that inactivate this kinase were found in families with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). In this study the Btk gene was analyzed in 13 registered Greek patients with XLA phenotype originated from 12 unrelated families, in order to provide a definite diagnosis of the XLA. The structure of Btk was analyzed at the cDNA level using the recently developed method, NIRCA (Non-Isotopic-Rnase-Cleavage-Assay). Alterations were detected in all patients and sequencing analysis confirmed the results and defined six novel XLA-associated Btk mutations (three missense mutations: C337G, L346R, L452P; one nonsense mutation: Y392X, and two frameshift alterations: c1211-1212delA, c1306-1307insA). Having defined the genetic alteration in the affected males of these families, the information was used to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and the Btk segments containing the mutated sequences were amplified from peripheral blood derived genomic DNA of potential female carriers. The PCR products were directly sequenced and carrier status was determined in 12 out of 16 phenotypically normal females analyzed. This protocol can be used once the nature of the Btk mutation has been defined in one of the affected males and provides a convenient, simple and reliable way to determine the carrier status of other female family members. Molecular genetic analysis constitutes a determinative tool for the definitive diagnosis of XLA and may allow accurate carrier and prenatal diagnosis for genetic counselling.},

The hydrolysis of polysaccharides, for example, is accelerated 190,000-fold when the temperature is raised from 25 to 100 degrees C, while the rate of hydrolysis of phosphate monoester dianions increases 10,300,000-fold. Moreover, the slowest reactions tend to be the most heat-sensitive. These tendencies collapse, by as many as five orders of magnitude, the time that would have been required for early chemical evolution in a warm environment. We propose, further, that if the catalytic effect of a "proto-enzyme"–like that of modern enzymes–were mainly enthalpic, then the resulting rate enhancement would have increased automatically as the environment became cooler. Several powerful nonenzymatic catalysts of very slow biological reactions, notably pyridoxal phosphate and the ceric ion, are shown to meet that criterion. Taken together, these findings greatly reduce the time that would have been required for early chemical evolution, countering the view that not enough time has passed for life to have evolved to its present level of complexity.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the rate enhancements produced by representative kinases and their thermodynamic basis, rate constants were determined as a function of changing temperature for 1) the spontaneous methanolysis of ATP and 2) reactions catalyzed by kinases to which different mechanisms of action have been ascribed. For each of these enzymes, the minor effects of changing viscosity indicate that k(cat)/K(m) is governed by the central chemical events in the enzyme-substrate complex rather than by enzyme-substrate encounter. Individual Arrhenius plots, obtained at intervals between pH 4.8 and 11.0, yielded Delta H(\#) and T Delta S(\#) for the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP(2-), ATP(3-), and ATP(4-) in the absence of Mg(2+). The addition of Mg(2+) led to partly compensating changes in Delta H(\#) and T Delta S(\#), accelerating the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP 11-fold at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. The rate enhancements produced by yeast hexokinase, homoserine kinase, and N-acetylgalactosamine kinase (obtained by comparison of their k(cat)/K(m) values in the presence of saturating phosphoryl acceptor with the second order rate constant for methanolysis of MgATP) ranged between 10(12)- and 10(14)-fold. Their nominal affinities for the altered substrates in the transition state were 2.1 x 10(-16) m for N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, 7.4 x 10(-17) m for homoserine kinase, and 6.4 x 10(-18) m for hexokinase. Compared with nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer, all three kinases were found to produce major reductions in the entropy of activation, in accord with the likelihood that substrate juxtaposition and desolvation play prominent roles in their catalytic action.},

To examine whether these putative signal peptides are functionally equivalent to signal peptides of secretory proteins, cDNA coding for a fusion protein was produced, in which the signal peptide for preproparathyroid hormone was replaced with the putative signal peptide of cytochrome P450IIC2. The translational product of RNA synthesized in vitro from the cDNA was neither processed nor translocated by chicken oviduct microsomal membranes in a reticulocyte cell-free system but was resistant to extraction from the membranes by alkaline solutions. In addition, the translation of the hybrid RNA was arrested by signal recognition particle. Unlike most signal peptides, the cytochrome P450IIC2 NH2-terminal sequence does not contain basic amino acids preceding the hydrophobic core. Introduction by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of lysine and arginine at the NH2 terminus resulted in a fusion protein that was partially processed by the microsomal membranes, with translocation across the membrane of both the processed and unprocessed proteins. The positive charges convert the cytochrome P450IIC2 NH2 terminus from a combination membrane insertion-halt transfer signal to a more classical secretory membrane-insertion signal, possibly by altering the orientation of the signal peptide in the membrane.

Insulin-sensitizing agents have been shown to improve both reproductive and metabolic aspects of PCOS, but it remains unclear whether it is also beneficial in lean patients without pre-treatment IR. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of metformin on the clinical and biochemical parameters of PCOS irrespective of the presence of basal obesity and IR. DESIGN: The effect of 6 months of metformin treatment was prospectively assessed in 188 PCOS patients, divided into three groups according to body mass index (BMI; lean: BMI{\textless}25 kg/m2, overweight: BMI 25-29 kg/m2, and obese: BMI30 kg/m2). Outcome parameters, which were also assessed in 102 healthy controls, included body weight, homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose and insulin levels, area under the curve of insulin response (AUCI), hyperandrogenism, and menstrual irregularities. RESULTS: In comparison with the respective BMI-appropriate control groups, only obese but not lean and overweight PCOS patients showed differences in fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. Metformin therapy significantly improved all outcome parameters except fasting glucose levels. Subgroup analyses revealed that in the group of lean PCOS patients without pre-treatment IR, metformin significantly improved HOMA-IR (1.7+/-1.0 vs 1.1+/-0.7 micromol/lxmmol/l2) and fasting insulin levels (7.7+/-4.2 vs 5.4+/-3.9 mU/l), in addition to testosterone levels (2.6+/-0.9 vs 1.8+/-0.7 nmol/l), anovulation rate (2.3 vs 59.5\%), and acne (31.8 vs 11.6\%; all P{\textless}0.017). In the overweight and obese PCOS groups, metformin also showed the expected beneficial effects.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data-driven studies on the dynamics of reconstructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks facilitate investigation and identification of proteins important for particular processes or diseases and reduces time and costs of experimental verification. Modeling the dynamics of very large PPI networks is computationally costly. RESULTS: To circumvent this problem, we created a link-weighted human immunome interactome and performed filtering. We reconstructed the immunome interactome and weighed the links using jackknife gene expression correlation of integrated, time course gene expression data. Statistical significance of the links was computed using the Global Statistical Significance (GloSS) filtering algorithm. P-values from GloSS were computed for the integrated, time course gene expression data. We filtered the immunome interactome to identify core components of the T cell PPI network (TPPIN). The interconnectedness of the major pathways for T cell survival and response, including the T cell receptor, MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways, are maintained in the TPPIN network. The obtained TPPIN network is supported both by Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis along with study of essential genes enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating gene expression data to the immunome interactome and using a weighted network filtering method, we identified the T cell PPI immune response network. This network reveals the most central and crucial network in T cells. The approach is general and applicable to any dataset that contains sufficient information.},

In this study, we have evaluated the performance of nine widely used pathogenicity prediction methods available on the Internet. The evaluated methods were MutPred, nsSNPAnalyzer, Panther, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen, PolyPhen2, SIFT, SNAP, and SNPs\&GO. The methods were tested with a set of over 40,000 pathogenic and neutral variants. We also assessed whether the type of original or substituting amino acid residue, the structural class of the protein, or the structural environment of the amino acid substitution, had an effect on the prediction performance. The performances of the programs ranged from poor (MCC 0.19) to reasonably good (MCC 0.65), and the results from the programs correlated poorly.

To understand the structural basis for the disease, we implemented methods from bioinformatics to analyze all the known HNE missense mutations at both the sequence and structural level. Our results demonstrate that the 32 different mutations have diverse effects on HNE structure and function, affecting structural disorder and aggregation tendencies, stability maintaining contacts, and electrostatic properties. A large proportion of the mutations are located at conserved amino acids, which are usually essential in determining protein structure and function. The majority of the disease-causing HNE missense mutations lead to major structural changes and loss of stability in the protein. A few mutations also affect functional residues, leading into decreased catalytic activity or altered ligand binding. Our analysis reveals the putative effects of all known missense mutations in HNE, thus allowing the structural basis of cyclic and congenital neutropenia to be elucidated. We have employed and analyzed a set of some 30 different methods for predicting the effects of amino acid substitutions. We present results and experience from the analysis of the applicability of these methods in the analysis of numerous genes, proteins, and diseases to reveal protein structure-function relationships and disease genotype-phenotype correlations.},

The interaction of CD40L on T-cells and its receptor CD40 on B-cells is essential for lymphocyte signalling leading to immunoglobulin class switching and B-cell maturation. To understand the structural basis for XHIGM, we utilised bioinformatics methods to analyse all the known CD40L missense mutations at both the sequence and structural level. Our results demonstrate that the 35 different missense mutations have diverse effects on CD40L structure and function, affecting structural disorder and aggregation tendencies, stability maintaining contacts and electrostatic properties. Several mutations also affect residues essential in receptor binding and trimerisation. Experimental study of effects of mutations is laborious and time-consuming and at the structural level often almost impossible. By contrast, precise and useful information about effects of mutations on protein structure and function can readily be obtained by theoretical methods.

Amino acid substitutions may have diverse effects on protein structure and function; thus, a detailed analysis of the mutations is essential. Experimental study of the molecular effects of mutations is laborious, whereas useful and reliable information about the effects of amino acid substitutions can readily be obtained by theoretical methods. Experimentally defined structures and molecular modeling can be used as a basis for interpretation of the mutations. The effects of missense mutations can be analyzed even when the 3D structure of the protein has not been determined, although structure-based analyses are more reliable. Structural analyses include studies of the contacts between residues, their implication for the stability of the protein, and the effects of the introduced residues. Investigations of steric and stereochemical consequences of substitutions provide insights on the molecular fit of the introduced residue. Mutations that change the electrostatic surface potential of a protein have wide-ranging effects. Analyses of the effects of mutations on interactions with ligands and partners have been performed for elucidation of functional mutations. We have employed numerous methods for predicting the effects of amino acid substitutions.

Initial lab tests showed mildly elevated serum sodium levels and low urine osmolality. Under water deprivation, diuresis and low urine osmolality persisted and serum sodium levels rose above 150 mmol/l. Oral desmopressin resulted in normalisation of serum sodium as well as urine osmolarity, confirming a diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus. As drug-induced diabetes could be excluded, pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. A demyelinating lesion was detected in the hypothalamus. The patient was started on oral desmopressin treatment (0.2 mg/day). Fluid intake and serum sodium levels have since remained normal. In summary, we report the rare case of a patient presenting with diabetes insipidus due to progressive MS.

Clustering of genes with related function(s) and/or characteristics has been evident at several different levels. To study how common the clustering of functionally related genes is and what kind of functions the end products of these genes are involved, we collected gene ontology (GO) terms for complete genomes and developed a method to detect previously undefined gene clustering. Exhaustive analysis was performed for seven widely studied species ranging from human to Escherichia coli. To overcome problems related to varying gene lengths and densities, a novel method was developed and a fixed number of genes were analyzed irrespective of the genome span covered. Statistically very significant GO term clustering was apparent in all the investigated genomes. The analysis window, which ranged from 5 to 50 consecutive genes, revealed extensive GO term clusters for genes with widely varying functions. Here, the most interesting and significant results are discussed and the complete dataset for each analyzed species is available at the GOme database at http://bioinf.uta.fi/GOme. The results indicated that clusters of genes with related functions are very common, not only in bacteria, in which operons are frequent, but also in all the studied species irrespective of how complex they are. There are some differences between species but in all of them GO term clusters are common and of widely differing sizes. The presented method can be applied to analyze any genome or part of a genome for which descriptive features are available, and thus is not restricted to ontology terms. This method can also be applied to investigate gene and protein expression patterns. The results pave a way for further studies of mechanisms that shape genome structure and evolutionary forces related to them.},

However, the combination of food, feed and fuel in one crop, although appealing, raises concerns related to the land delineation and distribution of maize grown for energy versus food and feed. To avoid this dilemma, the conversion of maize biomass into bioethanol must be improved.

The newly identified actions of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24R,25(OH)2D3) broadened the vitamin D3 endocrine system, however, the current data are fragmented and a systematic understanding is lacking. Here we performed the first systematic study of global gene expression to clarify their similarities and differences. Three metabolites at physiologically comparable levels were utilized to treat human and mouse fibroblasts prior to DNA microarray analyses. Human primary prostate stromal P29SN cells (hP29SN), which convert 25(OH)D3 into 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 by 1alpha-hydroxylase (encoded by the gene CYP27B1), displayed regulation of 164, 171, and 175 genes by treatment with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D3, and 24R,25(OH)2D3, respectively. Mouse primary Cyp27b1 knockout fibroblasts (mCyp27b1 (-/-)), which lack 1alpha-hydroxylation, displayed regulation of 619, 469, and 66 genes using the same respective treatments. The number of shared genes regulated by two metabolites is much lower in hP29SN than in mCyp27b1 (-/-). By using DAVID Functional Annotation Bioinformatics Microarray Analysis tools and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, we identified the agonistic regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling between 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 and unique non-classical actions of each metabolite in physiological and pathological processes, including cell cycle, keratinocyte differentiation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis signaling, gene transcription, immunomodulation, epigenetics, cell differentiation, and membrane protein expression. In conclusion, there are three distinct vitamin D3 hormones with clearly different biological activities.

XLA-causing mutations are collected in a mutation database (BTKbase), which is available at http://bioinf.uta.fi/BTKbase. For each patient the following information is given (when available): the identification of the entry, a plain English description of the mutation followed by a reference, formal characterization of the mutation, and the various parameters from the patient.

This is verified by flexibility indices, which are derived from normalized B-values of individual amino acids in several refined three-dimensional structures. Flexibility indices show that overall flexibility is reduced when thermostability is increased. Protein molecules require both flexibility and rigidity to function, but the higher the temperature optimum and stability the more rigid is the structure needed to compensate for increased thermal fluctuations. Flexibilities of proteins performing the same catalytic activity seem to be about the same at their temperature optima, but the more rigid thermostable proteins reach the flexibility of thermolabile proteins at higher temperatures. In several proteins such as allosteric enzymes, some local sites of flexibility are highly conserved. The relevance of reduced flexibility to overall stability of proteins is also discussed. Flexibility indices and profiles can be used in the design of more stable proteins by site-directed mutagenesis.},

The substrate specificity pocket of PSA resembles that of chymotrypsin and hGK is most related with tonin. The models were used to predict interactions with substrate and inhibitor molecules. The models are valuable in interpreting mutant and epitope mapping data as well as when modifying properties of the proteases or when developing diagnostic detection methods for prostatic cancer.},

In the next step many of the further studies will concentrate on proteins. Proteomics methods are essential for studying protein expression, activity, regulation and modifications. Bioinformatics is an integral part of proteomics research. The recent developments and applications in proteomics are discussed including mass spectrometry data analysis and interpretation, analysis and storage of the gel images to databases, gel comparison, and advanced methods to study e.g. protein co-expression, protein-protein interactions, as well as metabolic and cellular pathways. The significance of informatics in proteomics will gradually increase because of the advent of high-throughput methods relying on powerful data analysis.},

	volume = {13 Suppl 4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction methods are increasingly used in biosciences to forecast diverse features and characteristics. Binary two-state classifiers are the most common applications. They are usually based on machine learning approaches. For the end user it is often problematic to evaluate the true performance and applicability of computational tools as some knowledge about computer science and statistics would be needed. RESULTS: Instructions are given on how to interpret and compare method evaluation results. For systematic method performance analysis is needed established benchmark datasets which contain cases with known outcome, and suitable evaluation measures. The criteria for benchmark datasets are discussed along with their implementation in VariBench, benchmark database for variations. There is no single measure that alone could describe all the aspects of method performance. Predictions of genetic variation effects on DNA, RNA and protein level are important as information about variants can be produced much faster than their disease relevance can be experimentally verified. Therefore numerous prediction tools have been developed, however, systematic analyses of their performance and comparison have just started to emerge. CONCLUSIONS: The end users of prediction tools should be able to understand how evaluation is done and how to interpret the results. Six main performance evaluation measures are introduced. These include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Together with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis they provide a good picture about the performance of methods and allow their objective and quantitative comparison. A checklist of items to look at is provided. Comparisons of methods for missense variant tolerance, protein stability changes due to amino acid substitutions, and effects of variations on mRNA splicing are presented.},

This will enable readers to gain the full picture of technical information, performance, and interpretation of results, and to facilitate comparisons of related methods. Here, we provide instructions on how to describe new methods, report datasets, and assess the performance of predictive tools. We also discuss what details of predictor implementation are essential for authors to understand. Similarly, these guidelines for the use of predictors provide instructions on what needs to be delineated in the text, as well as how researchers can avoid unwarranted conclusions. They are applicable to most prediction methods currently utilized. By applying these guidelines, authors will help reviewers, editors, and readers to more fully comprehend prediction methods and their use.},

Several ontologies have been used to annotate numerous databases in biology and medicine. Due to their unambiguous nature, ontological annotations facilitate systematic description and data organization, data integration and mining, and pattern recognition and statistics, as well as development of analysis and prediction tools. The Variation Ontology (VariO) was developed to allow the annotation of effects, consequences, and mechanisms of DNA, RNA, and protein variations. Variation types are systematically organized, and a detailed description of effects and mechanisms is possible. VariO is for annotating the variant, not the normal-state features or properties, and requires a reference (e.g., reference sequence, reference-state property, activity, etc.) compared to which the changes are indicated. VariO is versatile and can be used for variations ranging from genomic multiplications to single nucleotide or amino acid changes, whether of genetic or nongenetic origin. VariO annotations are position-specific and can be used for variations in any organism.},

Although lots of variation data is available it is often difficult to use due to lack of systematics. RESULTS: A novel ontology, Variation Ontology (VariO http://variationontology.org), was developed for annotation of effects, consequences and mechanisms of variations. In this article instructions are provided on how VariO annotations are made. The major levels for description are the three molecules, namely DNA, RNA and protein. They are further divided to four major sublevels: variation type, function, structure, and property, and further up to eight sublevels. VariO annotation summarizes existing knowledge about a variation and its effects and formalizes it so that computational analyses are efficient. The annotations should be made on as many levels as possible. VariO annotations are made in reference to normal states, which vary for each data item including e.g. reference sequences, wild type properties, and activities. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed instructions together with examples are provided to indicate how VariO can be used for annotation of variations and their effects. A dedicated tool has been developed for annotation and will be further developed to cover also evidence for the annotations. VariO is suitable for annotation of data in many types of databases. As several different kinds of databases are in a process of adapting VariO annotations it is important to have guidelines to guarantee consistent annotation.},

More than 80 primary immunodeficiencies are known to date. During the last years genes for several of these disorders have been identified. Here, mutation information for 23 genes affected in 14 immunodefects is presented. The proteins produced are employed in widely diverse functions, such as signal transduction, cell surface receptors, nucleotide metabolism, gene diversification, transcription factors, and phagocytosis. Altogether, the genetic defect of 2,140 families has been determined. Diseases with X-chromosomal origin constitute about 70\% of all the cases, presumably due to full penetrance and because the single affected allele causes the phenotype. All types of mutations have been identified; missense mutations are the most common mutation type, and truncation is the most common effect on the protein level. Mutational hotspots in many disorders appear in CPG dinucleotides. The mutation data for the majority of diseases are distributed on the Internet with a special database management system, MUTbase.

	abstract = {Liquefying-type Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase was characterized. The coding gene was cloned in Bacillus subtilis and the enzyme was produced in three different host organisms: B. stearothermophilus, B. subtilis, and Escherichia coli. Properties of the purified enzyme were similar irrespective of the host. Temperature optimum was at 70-80 degrees C and pH optimum at 5.0-6.0. The enzyme was stable for 1 h in the pH range 6.0-7.5 at 80 degrees C. The enzyme was stabilized by Ca2+, Na+, and bovine serum albumin. About 50\% of the activity remained after heating at 70 degrees C for 5 days or 45 min at 90 degrees C. Metal ions Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ were inhibitory, whereas EDTA, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, and Tendamistat were without effect. The enzyme was fully active after treatment in acetone or ethanol at 55 or 70 degrees C, respectively, for 30 min. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (1\%) did not affect stability, whereas 6 M urea denatured totally at 70 degrees C. The Km value for soluble starch was 14 mg/ml. Mr is 59,000 and pI 8.8. The only difference between the enzymes produced in different hosts was in signal peptide processing.},

The accuracy of four flexibility prediction techniques was studied by comparing atomic temperature factors of known three-dimensional protein structures to predictions by using correlation coefficients. The size of the prediction window was optimized for each method. Predictions made with our new parameters, using an optimized window size of 9 residues in the prediction window, were giving the best results. The difference from another previously used technique was small, whereas two other methods were much poorer. Applicability of the predictions was also tested by searching for known epitopes from amino acid sequences. The best techniques predicted correctly 20 of 31 continuous epitopes in seven proteins. Flexibility parameters have previously been used for calculating protein average flexibility indices which are inversely correlated to protein stability. Indices with the new parameters showed better correlation to protein stability than those used previously; furthermore they had relationship even when the old parameters failed.},

Characterization of the cellular and molecular bases of SCID is essential to provide accurate genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis, and it may offer the grounds for alternative forms of treatment. The Jak3 gene is mutated in most cases of autosomal recessive T(-)B(+) SCID in humans. Jak3 belongs to the family of intracellular Janus tyrosine kinases. It is physically and functionally coupled to the common gamma chain, gammac, shared by several cytokine receptors. We have established the JAK3base registry for disease and mutation information. In order to study the structural consequences of the Jak3 mutations, the structure of the human Jak3 kinase and pseudokinase domains was modeled. Residues involved in ATP and Mg(2+) binding were highly conserved in the kinase domain whereas the substrate binding region is somewhat different compared to other kinases. We have identified the first naturally occurring mutations disrupting the function of the human Jak3 kinase domain. The structural basis of all of the known Jak3 mutations reported so far is discussed based on the modeled structure. The model of the Jak3 protein also permits us to study Jak3 phosphorylation at the structural level and may thus serve in the design of novel immune suppressive drugs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated circulating markers of bone turnover before and during systemic glucocorticoid treatment in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Twenty-two children (mean age, 12.3 years) with IBD necessitating peroral steroid therapy were studied, with special reference to bone formation and resorption markers amino-terminal type I collagen propeptide (PINP) and carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) respectively. In addition, GH-related IGF-I and sex hormone-binding protein (SHBG) were measured. Bone markers were analyzed at the initiation of the glucocorticoid treatment, at 2 and 5 weeks thereafter and at 1 month following the withdrawal of the steroid. Control group comprised 22 IBD patients in remission. RESULTS: PINP and IGF-I were already lower before glucocorticoid treatment serum in children with active IBD as compared with control children with IBD in remission (median PINP 271 vs 535 microg/l, P{\textless}0.05; IGF-I 23 vs 29 nmol/l, P{\textless}0.05). After 2 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment serum PINP levels had declined further, from 271 to 163 microg/l (P{\textless}0.001), serum ICTP from 14.2 to 9.6 microg/l (P{\textless}0.001), and SHBG from 54 to 35 nmol/l (P{\textless}0.001) respectively. By contrast, serum IGF-I increased from 23 to 37 nmol/l (P{\textless}0.001). One month after the withdrawal of the glucocorticoid, all bone markers restored to levels similar to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Bone formation in children with active IBD appears compromised and systemic glucocorticoid treatment further suppresses bone turnover. After the cessation of the glucocorticoid the bone markers show immediate improvement.},

GBA levels did not predict the development of glucocorticoid-related side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Prednisolone doses used in the treatment of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients elicit a 4-fold increase in serum GBA that is significantly higher than the increase induced by budesonide. The GBA measurement is an additional tool for assessing steroid therapy at an individual level during systemic glucocorticoid treatment.},

	volume = {97},
	abstract = {Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of primary immunodeficiencies, a proportion of which are due to mutations in either of the 2 recombination activating genes (RAG)-1 and -2, which mediate the process of V(D)J recombination leading to the assembly of antigen receptor genes. It is reported here that the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of patients bearing mutations in RAGs are more diverse than previously thought and that this variability is related, in part, to the specific type of RAG mutation. By analyzing 44 such patients from 41 families, the following conclusions were reached: (1) null mutations on both alleles lead to the T-B-SCID phenotype; (2) patients manifesting classic Omenn syndrome (OS) have missense mutations on at least one allele and maintain partial V(D)J recombination activity, which accounts for the generation of residual, oligoclonal T-lymphocytes; (3) in a third group of patients, findings were only partially compatible with OS, and these patients, who also carried at least one missense mutation, may be considered to have atypical SCID/OS; (4) patients with engraftment of maternal T cells as a complication of a transplacental transfusion represented a fourth group, and these patients, who often presented with a clinical phenotype mimicking OS, may be observed regardless of the type of RAG gene mutation. Analysis of the RAG genes by direct sequencing is an effective way to provide accurate diagnosis of RAG-deficient as opposed to RAG-independent V(D)J recombination defects, a distinction that cannot be made based on clinical and immunologic phenotype alone.},

	abstract = {The PrsA protein of Bacillus subtilis is an essential membrane-bound lipoprotein that is assumed to assist post-translocational folding of exported proteins and stabilize them in the compartment between the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall. This folding activity is consistent with the homology of a segment of PrsA with parvulin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIase). In this study, molecular modeling showed that the parvulin-like region can adopt a parvulin-type fold with structurally conserved active site residues. PrsA exhibits PPIase activity in a manner dependent on the parvulin-like domain. We constructed deletion, peptide insertion, and amino acid substitution mutations and demonstrated that the parvulin-like domain as well as flanking N- and C-terminal domains are essential for in vivo PrsA function in protein secretion and growth. Surprisingly, none of the predicted active site residues of the parvulin-like domain was essential for growth and protein secretion, although several active site mutations reduced or abolished the PPIase activity or the ability of PrsA to catalyze proline-limited protein folding in vitro. Our results indicate that PrsA is a PPIase, but the essential role in vivo seems to depend on some non-PPIase activity of both the parvulin-like and flanking domains.},

Using Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) assay, amplifying all 19 exons and the putative promoter region with a single annealling temperature, mutations have been identified in 19 out of 24 unrelated patients diagnosed as having XLA. Apart from a large deletion involving exon 19, nine missense (F25S, R288W, 1370M, M509V, R525P, N526K, R562W, A582V and G594R), two nonsense (E277X and R525X), five frameshift and two splice site mutations have been found affecting most coding exons and all major enzyme domains. No mutations or polymorphisms were detected in the putative promoter region. A single nucleotide deletion located in the last exon, resulting in a truncation of the eight C-terminal residues of Btk and a typical XLA phenotype, indicates structural and/or functional importance of Btk helix I in the catalytic domain. Although allelic heterogeneity at the BTK locus may partly explain clinical variability in families with XLA, compensatory and redundant mechanisms involved in B-cell development must play a role in the phenotypic diversity of the disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The comparison of samples, or beta diversity, is one of the essential problems in ecological studies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies make it possible to obtain large amounts of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic short read sequences across many microbial communities. De novo assembly of the short reads can be especially challenging because the number of genomes and their sequences are generally unknown and the coverage of each genome can be very low, where the traditional alignment-based sequence comparison methods cannot be used. Alignment-free approaches based on k-tuple frequencies, on the other hand, have yielded promising results for the comparison of metagenomic samples. However, it is not known if these approaches can be used for the comparison of metatranscriptome datasets and which dissimilarity measures perform the best. RESULTS: We applied several beta diversity measures based on k-tuple frequencies to real metatranscriptomic datasets from pyrosequencing 454 and Illumina sequencing platforms to evaluate their effectiveness for the clustering of metatranscriptomic samples, including three d2-type dissimilarity measures, one dissimilarity measure in CVTree, one relative entropy based measure S2 and three classical 1p-norm distances. Results showed that the measure d2(S) can achieve superior performance on clustering metatranscriptomic samples into different groups under different sequencing depths for both 454 and Illumina datasets, recovering environmental gradients affecting microbial samples, classifying coexisting metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, and being robust to sequencing errors. We also investigated the effects of tuple size and order of the background Markov model. A software pipeline to implement all the steps of analysis is built and is available at http://code.google.com/p/d2-tools/. CONCLUSIONS: The k-tuple based sequence signature measures can effectively reveal major groups and gradient variation among metatranscriptomic samples from NGS reads. The d2(S) dissimilarity measure performs well in all application scenarios and its performance is robust with respect to tuple size and order of the Markov model.},

Using a top-gate device geometry with 12 nm HfO(2) being the gate oxide, the SBG CNT-based FET exhibits an almost perfect symmetric ambipolar transfer characteristic without any noticeable hysteresis, and a highly efficient frequency doubler is constructed based on this near perfect ambipolar FET. The SBG CNT-based frequency doubler is shown to be able to operate in a large signal mode where the input AC signal, being applied to the top-gate electrode, drives the FET operating alternatively in a p- or n-region yielding an output signal at the drain electrode with doubled frequency and high conversion efficiency. For an input AC signal of 1 kHz, detailed frequency power spectrum analysis shows that more than 95\% of the output signal is concentrated at the doubled frequency at 2 kHz, with a gain of more than 0.15, and this represents the highest gain so far achieved in carbon-based devices, including graphene-based devices.},

This European multicenter trial was initiated to develop a consensus of 2 existing classification schemes based on flowcytometric B-cell phenotyping and the clinical course. The clinical evaluation of 303 patients with the established diagnosis of CVID demonstrated a significant coincidence of granulomatous disease, autoimmune cytopenia, and splenomegaly. Phenotyping of B-cell subpopulations confirmed a severe reduction of switched memory B cells in most of the patients that was associated with a higher risk for splenomegaly and granulomatous disease. An expansion of CD21(low) B cells marked patients with splenomegaly. Lymphadenopathy was significantly linked with transitional B-cell expansion. Based on these findings and pathogenic consideration of B-cell differentiation, we suggest an improved classification for CVID (EUROclass), separating patients with nearly absent B cells (less than 1\%), severely reduced switched memory B cells (less than 2\%), and expansion of transitional (more than 9\%) or CD21(low) B cells (more than 10\%). Whereas the first group contains all patients with severe defects of early B-cell differentiation, severely reduced switched memory B cells indicate a defective germinal center development as found in inducible constimulator (ICOS) or CD40L deficiency. The underlying defects of expanded transitional or CD21(low) B cells remain to be elucidated.

This may be especially important in practical terms when real-world applications of the classifier are either highly imbalanced or occur in unknown proportions. Intuitively, it may seem sensible to train machine learning models on data similar to the target data in terms of proportions of the two binary outcomes. However, we show that this is not the case using the example of prediction of deleterious and neutral phenotypes of human missense mutations in human genome data, for which the proportion of the binary outcome is unknown. Our results indicate that using balanced training data (50\% neutral and 50\% deleterious) results in the highest balanced accuracy (the average of True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate), Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under ROC curves, no matter what the proportions of the two phenotypes are in the testing data. Besides balancing the data by undersampling the majority class, other techniques in machine learning include oversampling the minority class, interpolating minority-class data points and various penalties for misclassifying the minority class. However, these techniques are not commonly used in either the missense phenotype prediction problem or in the prediction of disordered residues in proteins, where the imbalance problem is substantial. The appropriate approach depends on the amount of available data and the specific problem at hand.},

	title = {Targeting presenilin-type aspartic protease signal peptide peptidase with gamma-secretase inhibitors},
	volume = {278},
	abstract = {Presenilin is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It is thought to constitute the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex that catalyzes intramembrane cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein, the last step in the generation of amyloidogenic Abeta peptides. The latter are major constituents of amyloid plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Inhibitors of gamma-secretase are considered potential therapeutics for the treatment of this disease because they prevent production of Abeta peptides. Recently, we discovered a family of presenilin-type aspartic proteases. The founding member, signal peptide peptidase, catalyzes intramembrane cleavage of distinct signal peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of animals. In humans, the protease plays a crucial role in the immune system. Moreover, it is exploited by the hepatitis C virus for the processing of the structural components of the virion and hence is an attractive target for anti-infective intervention. Signal peptide peptidase and presenilin share identical active site motifs and both catalyze intramembrane proteolysis. These common features let us speculate that gamma-secretase inhibitors directed against presenilin may also inhibit signal peptide peptidase. Here we demonstrate that some of the most potent known gamma-secretase inhibitors efficiently inhibit signal peptide peptidase. However, we found compounds that showed higher specificity for one or the other protease. Our findings highlight the possibility of developing selective inhibitors aimed at reducing Abeta generation without affecting other intramembrane-cleaving aspartic proteases.},

Furthermore, we detected signals corresponding to an alteration of positively and negatively charged residues at a distance of 3-4 amino acids. To look beyond the property codes gained by the methods of physical chemistry, mappings yielding a strong correlation signal are sought for using a Monte Carlo simulation. The mappings leading to strong signals are found to be related to hydrophobicity of alpha-helix propensity. A cluster analysis of the top scoring mappings leads to two novel property codes. These two property codes are gained from sequence data only. They turn out to be similar to known property codes for hydrophobicity or polarity.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the rapid inhibition of bacterial cytidine deaminase by 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine, the onset of inhibition of the enzyme from human liver was found to be relatively slow. Inhibition was found to be reversible, and the corrected rate constants for binding (kon = 2.4 x 10(4) M-1 sec-1) and release (koff = 5.6 x 10(-4) sec-1) were in reasonable agreement with a Ki value (2.9 x 10(-8) M) measured separately under steady-state conditions, which was several orders of magnitude lower than estimates previously reported in the literature. Rates of binding and release of this potential transition state analogue were not appreciably affected by the substitution of deuterium oxide for solvent water. The slow onset of inhibition, which was also observed for cytidine deaminase from HeLa cells, suggests that structural reorganization precedes the formation of a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex. 6-Azacytidine, which favors a "high-anti" configuration at the glycosidic bond, was found to be active as a substrate for cytidine deaminase, with a turnover number exceeding that of cytidine. 2,2'-Anhydro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, which is restricted to the "syn" configuration, was found to be without activity as a substrate or an inhibitor.},

	abstract = {The comparative endocrinology of the 37-amino-acid-residue islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is poorly known, possibly due to the fact that available antisera, raised against mammalian IAPP, fail to give immunoreactivity with islet parenchymal cells of non-mammalian vertebrates. Using reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers, IAPP was identified, and its deduced amino-acid sequence partially characterized, in three species of teleostean fish, i.e. Danio rerio (zebrafish), Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon), and Myoxocephalus (cottus) scorpius (daddy sculpin). The daddy sculpin is a species where the histophysiology of the pancreatic islet parenchyma has previously been comprehensively studied. From the deduced amino-acid sequence, a synthetic peptide, corresponding to positions 20-29 of Salmo IAPP, was synthesized. A mouse antiserum to this peptide gave a distinct immunoreactivity with the insulin-producing beta cells of the sculpin Brockmann bodies and salmon endocrine pancreas. Thus, IAPP belongs to the group of peptide hormones expressed by the islet parenchymal cells in both mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. Salmo salar IAPP(20-29) was found to give rise to amyloid-like fibrils in vitro.},

For acetic acid this coefficient is 1.1 X 10(-5), for acetamide 7.6 X 10(-8), for N-methylacetamide 4.1 X 10(-8), and for N,N-dimethylacetamide 5.4 X 10(-7). Thus acetamide is much more strongly solvated than the uncharged acetic acid molecule. The results suggest: (1) that the peptide bond represents an extreme among uncharged functional groups in the degree to which it is stabilized by solvent water; (2) that the very great hydrophilic character of the peptide bond may be associated mainly with hydrogen bonding of the solvent to the carbonyl oxygen atom (rather than the N-H group); and (3) that the observed equilibria of biosynthesis and hydrolysis of peptide bonds in aqueous solution are largely determined by differences between reactants and products in their free energies of solvation. It is anticipated that where "bound" water is found in proteins, it will often be found to be associated with peptide bonds, and will tend to be associated with the C-O group rather than with the N-H group.},

It subsumes potential effects of substrate desolvation, H-bonding and other polar attractions, and the juxtaposition of several substrates in a configuration appropriate for reaction. The startling rate enhancements that some enzymes produce have only recently been recognized. Direct measurements of the binding affinities of stable transition-state analog inhibitors confirm the remarkable power of binding discrimination of enzymes. Several parts of the enzyme and substrate, that contribute to S binding, exhibit extremely large connectivity effects, with effective relative concentrations in excess of 10(8) M. Exact structures of enzyme complexes with transition-state analogs also indicate a general tendency of enzyme active sites to close around S in such a way as to maximize binding contacts.

	abstract = {The rates of enzyme reactions fall within a relatively narrow range. To estimate the rate enhancements produced by enzymes, and their expected affinities for transition state analog inhibitors, it is necessary to measure the rates of the corresponding reactions in water in the absence of a catalyst. This review describes the spontaneous cleavages of C-C, C-H, C-N, C-O, P-O, and S-O bonds in biological molecules, as well as the uncatalyzed reactions that correspond to phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by kinases and to peptidyl transfer in the ribosome. The rates of these reactions, some with half-lives in excess of one million years, span an overall range of 10(1)(9)-fold. Moreover, the slowest reactions tend to be most sensitive to temperature, with rates that increase as much as 10(7)-fold when the temperature is raised from 25 degrees to 100 degrees C. That tendency collapses, by many orders of magnitude, the time that would have been required for chemical evolution on a warm earth. If the catalytic effect of primitive enzymes, like that of modern enzymes and many nonenzymatic catalysts, were mainly to reduce a reaction's enthalpy of activation, then the resulting rate enhancement would have increased automatically as the surroundings cooled. By reducing the time required for early chemical evolution in a warm environment, these findings counter the view that not enough time has passed for terrestrial life to have evolved to its present level of complexity.},

More recently, it has become apparent that life originated very early in Earth's history, and there has been controversy as to whether life originated in a hot or cold environment. This review describes evidence that rising temperature accelerates slow reactions disproportionately, and to a much greater extent than has been generally recognized. Thus, the time that would have been required for primordial chemistry to become established would have been abbreviated profoundly at high temperatures. Moreover, if the catalytic effect of a primitive enzyme (like that of modern enzymes) were to reduce a reaction's heat of activation, then the rate enhancement that it produced would have increased as the surroundings cooled, quite aside from changes arising from mutation (which is itself highly sensitive to temperature). Some nonenzymatic catalysts of slow reactions, including PLP as a catalyst of amino acid decarboxylation, and the Ce(IV) ion as a catalyst of phosphate ester hydrolysis, have been shown to meet that criterion. The work reviewed here suggests that elevated temperatures collapsed the time required for early evolution on Earth, furnishing an appropriate setting for exploring the vast range of chemical possibilities and for the rapid evolution of enzymes from primitive catalysts.},

To determine whether these relationships might also have been valid in the warm surroundings where life may have originated, we examined the effect of temperature on the hydrophobicities of the amino acids as measured by the equilibrium constants for transfer of their side-chains from neutral solution to cyclohexane (Kw {\textgreater} c). The hydrophobicities of most amino acids were found to increase with increasing temperature. Because that effect is more pronounced for the more polar amino acids, the numerical range of Kw {\textgreater} c values decreases with increasing temperature. There are also modest changes in the ordering of the more polar amino acids. However, those changes are such that they would have tended to minimize the otherwise disruptive effects of a changing thermal environment on the evolution of protein structure. Earlier, the genetic code was found to be organized in such a way that-with a single exception (threonine)-the side-chain dichotomy polar/nonpolar matches the nucleic acid base dichotomy purine/pyrimidine at the second position of each coding triplet at 25 degrees C. That dichotomy is preserved at 100 degrees C. The accessible surface areas of amino acid side-chains in folded proteins are moderately correlated with hydrophobicity, but when free energies of vapor-to-cyclohexane transfer (corresponding to size) are taken into consideration, a closer relationship becomes apparent.},

Free energies of binding can therefore be considered to depend on free energies of solvation of the interacting partners before and after complexation. Because carbohydrates contain so many polar substituents, their overall preferences for aqueous surroundings are overwhelming, so that they do not yield readily to analysis of their solvation properties. We therefore decided to eliminate most of the secondary hydroxyl groups and to compare the distribution properties of simple sugar analogs based on tetrahydropyran. The results suggest that compounds containing an anomeric hydroxyl group are less strongly solvated than expected from the properties of simple alcohols. Group transfer potentials of O- and N-glycosides, lactones, and acylals are substantially affected by differences in free energy of solvation between reactants and products. In contrast, equilibria of ring chain tautomerism and covalent hydration of aldoses are almost completely insensitive to the polarity of their surroundings.},

Thermodynamic comparisons between spontaneous and enzyme-catalyzed reactions, coupled with structural information, suggest that in addition to electrostatic and H-bonding interactions, the liberation of water molecules from an enzyme's active site into bulk solvent sometimes plays a prominent role in determining the relative binding affinities of the altered substrate in the ground state and transition state. These comparisons also indicate a high level of synergism in the action of binding determinants of both the substrate and the enzyme, that are not directly involved in the chemical transformation of the substrate but contribute to the rate of its transformation at an enzyme's active site.},

Substituent ribose thus appears to stabilize, selectively, the transition state for enzymatic deamination. In contrast with the small influence of substituent ribose on the apparent binding affinity of substrates, removal of substituent ribose from a potential transition state analogue, 1,6-dihydro-6-hydroxy-methylpurine ribonucleoside, results in a lowering of its affinity for the enzyme by several orders of magnitude. The synthesis of the analogue and related compounds is described, and their properties compared with those of other photoadducts and of the naturally occurring inhibitors covidarabine and coformycin.

	abstract = {Alkyl sulfate monoesters are involved in cell signaling and structure. Alkyl sulfates are also present in many commercial detergents. Here, we show that monomethyl sulfate acts as an efficient alkylating agent in water, reacting spontaneously with oxygen nucleophiles {\textgreater}100-fold more rapidly than do alkylsulfonium ions, the usual methyl donors in living organisms. These reactions of methyl sulfate, which are much more rapid than its hydrolysis, are insensitive to the nature of the attacking nucleophile, with a Bronsted beta(nuc) value of -0.01. Experiments at elevated temperatures indicate a rate constant of 2 x 10(-11) s(-1) for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of methyl sulfate at 25 degrees C (t(1/2) = 1,100 y), corresponding to a rate enhancement of approximately 10(11)-fold by a human alkylsulfatase. Equilibria of formation of methyl sulfate from methanol and sodium hydrogen sulfate indicate a group transfer potential (DeltaG'(pH7)) of -8.9 kcal/mol for sulfate ester hydrolysis. The magnitude of that value, involving release of the strong acid HSO(4)(-), helps to explain the need for harnessing the free energy of hydrolysis of two ATP molecules in activating sulfate for the biosynthesis of sulfate monoesters. The "energy-rich" nature of monoalkyl sulfate esters, coupled with their marked resistance to hydrolysis, renders them capable of acting as sulfating or alkylating agents under relatively mild conditions. These findings raise the possibility that, under appropriate circumstances, alkyl groups may undergo transfer from alkyl sulfate monoesters to biological target molecules.},

Thus, polysaccharide hydrolases (e.g., beta-amylase) generate the largest rate enhancements that are known to be produced by hydrolytic enzymes that operate without the assistance of metals or other cofactors.(6) Here, we describe the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of sucrose and trehalose, in which the constituent monosaccharides are symmetrically joined, by a "head-to-head" glycosidic linkage between their carbonyl groups (Chart ).},

A total of 3 experiments were performed to assess the infection and clearance rate of each of these constructs. Each construct or Salmonella Enteriditis was orally administered to broiler chicks at day of hatch by oral gavage ( 10(8) cfu/chick). In experiments 1 to 3, liver-spleen and cecal tonsils were removed aseptically for recovery of wild-type Salmonella Enteriditis or DeltaSE mutants. These experiments suggested that cell surface expression of fliC alone markedly increased the clearance rate of the vector at or before 21d postvaccination in all 3 experiments. In a fourth experiment, broilers were vaccinated with one of the vaccine constructs or the DeltaSE empty vector and then challenged with wild-type Salmonella Typhimurium. At 19 d posthatch, 16 d postinfection, neither candidate protected against challenge significantly better than the DeltaSE empty vector, although there was significantly less Salmonella recovered from vaccinated chickens as compared with nonvaccinated controls. These experiments indicate that these experimental vaccines did not protect against heterologous challenge or enhance clearance after Salmonella Typhimurium challenge; as such, their value as vaccines is limited. The increased clearance of the candidate vaccines, particularly the vector expressing fliC alone, may have value in that the fliC epitope may decrease the clearance time of other recombinant vectored Salmonella vaccines.},

Additionally, an effective direct-fed microbial (DFM) may offer an effective alternative to antibiotic growth promoters. Previously, 4 Bacillus isolates were identified and evaluated in our laboratory as potential DFM candidates. These isolates were shown to significantly increase BWG as well as reduce recovery of Salmonella after experimental infection. In the first experiment, isolates PHL-MM65 (a Bacillus laterosporus) and PHL-NP122 (a Bacillus subtilis) were evaluated using poults raised under commercial conditions. After 7 d of conventional brooding, poults were tagged, weighed, and placed in 1 of 4 replicate pens for each treatment group [negative control, 0.019\% nitarsone, PHL-MM65 (10(6) spores/g of feed), or PHL-NP122 (10(6) spores/g of feed)] within the commercial turkey barn. At 23 d, poults were weighed and BW was calculated. Treatment with PHL-NP122 (853 g) or nitarsone (852 g) increased BW (P {\textless}/= 0.05) compared with control (784 g), whereas treatment with PHL-MM65 (794 g) did not significantly improve BW. Also on d 23 of the trial, ceca were aseptically removed from 10 poults per pen and cultured for recovery of Salmonella. Both Bacillus isolates PHL-NP122 and PHL-MM65 resulted in a significant reduction (P {\textless}/= 0.05) in the frequency of Salmonella by more than 25\% compared with the controls. In a second experiment on a different farm, isolates PHL-NP122, PHL-RW33 (a B. subtilis), and PHL-B1 (a Bacillus licheniformis) were evaluated. None of the candidate Bacillus DFM or the group fed nitarsone had significantly different BW or BWG than untreated control. These data suggest that isolate PHL-NP122, when added as a DFM to turkey diets, may increase BW gain as well as nitarsone during the brooding phase of commercial turkey production.},

	abstract = {Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree) and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine (SVM) framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the SVM method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80\% sensitivity and 99.6\% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes, which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool (SpiderP) is freely available on ArachnoServer (http://www.arachnoserver.org/spiderP.html), a web portal to a comprehensive relational database of spider toxins. All training data, test data, and scripts used are available from the SpiderP website.},

X-ray crystal structures of complexes with the two matched inhibitors differ only near a "trapped" water molecule in the complex with the 3,4-dihydro analog, where contacts are substantially less favorable than those with the hydroxyl group of the transition-state analog. The hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the Glu 104 carboxylate shortens in that complex, and may become a "low-barrier" hydrogen bond, since at the same time the bond between zinc and the Cys 132 thiolate ligand lengthens. These differences must therefore account for most of the differential binding affinity related to catalysis. Moreover, the trapped water molecule retains some of the binding energy stabilizing the hydroxyl group in the transition-state analog complex. To this extent, the ratio of binding affinities for the two compounds is smaller than the true contribution of the hydroxyl group, a conclusion with significant bearing on interpreting difference free energies derived from substituent effects arising from chemical modification and/or mutagenesis.},

(1995) Biochemistry 34, 4516-4523]. Difference Fourier maps between the deazacytidine, dihydrozebularine, and zebularine–hydrate inhibitor complexes suggest that the ring itself moves successively toward the activated water, leaving the amino group behind in this site as the substrate complex approaches the transition state. They also reveal systematic changes in a single zinc-sulfur bond distance. These correlate with chemical changes expected as the substrate approaches the tetrahedral transition state, in which the zinc-activated hydroxyl group develops maximal negative charge and forms a short hydrogen bond to the neighboring carboxylate group of Glu 104. Empirical bond valence relationships suggest that the Zn-S gamma 132 bond functions throughout the reaction as a "valence buffer" that accommodates changing negative charge on the hydroxyl group. Similar structural features in alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that analogous mechanisms may be a general feature of catalysis by zinc enzymes.},

	abstract = {Crystal structures of the cytidine deaminase-uridine product complex prepared either by cocrystallizing enzyme with uridine or by diffusing cytidine into ligand-free crystals show that the product binds as a 4-ketopyrimidine. They reveal four additional features of the catalytic process. (1) A water molecule bound to a site previously observed to bind the incoming 4-NH2 group represents the site for the leaving ammonia molecule. The conserved Pro 128 accommodates both moieties by orienting the carbonyl group of the previous residue. (2) The Glu 104 carboxylate group rotates from its hydrogen bond to the O4 hydroxyl group in transition-state analog complexes, forming a new hydrogen bond to the leaving group moiety. Thus, after stabilizing the hydroxyl group in the transition state, Glu 104 transfers a proton from that group to the leaving amino group, promoting enol-to-keto isomerization of the product. (3) Difference Fourier comparisons with transition-state complexes indicate that the pyrimidine ring rotates toward the zinc by approximately 10 degrees. The active site thus "pulls" the ring and 4-NH2 group in opposite directions during catalysis. To preserve coplanarity of the 4-keto group with the pyrimidine ring, the N1-C1' glycosidic bond bends by approximately 19 degrees out of the ring plane. This distortion may "spring-load" the product complex and promote dissociation. Failure to recognize a similar distortion could explain an earlier crystallographic interpretation of the adenosine deaminase-inosine complex [Wilson, D. K., \& Quiocho, F. A. (1994) Nat. Struct. Biol. 1, 691-694]. (4) The Zn-Sgamma132 bond, which lengthens in transition-state complexes, shortens as the O4 atom returns to a state of lower negative charge in the planar product, consistent with our previous proposal that this bond buffers the zinc bond valence, compensating buildup of negative charge on the oxygen nucleophile during catalysis.},

	abstract = {The structural gene that encodes cytidine deaminase (cdd) in Escherichia coli was cloned from Kohara phage lambda 365 (7F1), and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Plasmids harboring the gene complemented chromosomal cdd mutations, enhanced cytidine deaminase activity in cell extracts, and directed the synthesis of a protein identical in mass and N-terminal amino acid sequence with cytidine deaminase purified from wild-type bacteria. Metal analysis of the purified, plasmid-encoded deaminase indicated a single atom of tightly bound zinc per subunit. Earlier work has shown that bacterial cytidine deaminase and mammalian adenosine deaminase are remarkably alike in their mechanisms of action, in their free energies of interaction with analogue inhibitors resembling tetrahedral intermediates in nucleophilic substitution, and in their ability to discriminate between analogue inhibitors differing by a single hydroxyl group. In contrast to these shared catalytic similarities, the deduced amino acid sequence of E. coli cytidine deaminase (monomer MW 31,540) differs markedly from the mammalian adenosine deaminase sequence suggesting major differences in their tertiary structures. Nevertheless, cytidine deaminase and mammalian plus bacterial adenosine deaminases share a single region (TVHA) of sequence identity that is tentatively identified as part of the cytidine deaminase active site.},

	abstract = {Predicting the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein stability provides invaluable information for protein design, the assignment of biological function, and for understanding disease-associated variations. To understand the effects of substitutions, computational models are preferred to time-consuming and expensive experimental methods. Several methods have been proposed for this task including machine learning-based approaches. However, models trained using limited data have performance problems and many model parameters tend to be over-fitted. To decrease the number of model parameters and to improve the generalization potential, we calculated the amino acid contact energy change for point variations using a structure-based coarse-grained model. Based on the structural properties including contact energy (CE) and further physicochemical properties of the amino acids as input features, we developed two support vector machine classifiers. M47 predicted the stability of variant proteins with an accuracy of 87 \% and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.68 for a large dataset of 1925 variants, whereas M8 performed better when a relatively small dataset of 388 variants was used for 20-fold cross-validation. The performance of the M47 classifier on all six tested contingency table evaluation parameters is better than that of existing machine learning-based models or energy function-based protein stability classifiers.},

	title = {Alteration in the {IL}-2 signal peptide affects secretion of proteins in vitro and in vivo},
	volume = {7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although hundreds of different signal peptides have now been identified, few studies have examined the factors enabling signal peptides to augment secretion of mature proteins. Signal peptides, located at the N-terminus of nascent secreted proteins, characteristically have three domains: (1) a basic domain at the N-terminus, (2) a central hydrophobic core, and (3) a carboxy-terminal cleavage region. In this study, we investigated whether alterations in the basic and/or the hydrophobic domains of a commonly used signal peptide from interleukin-2 (IL-2) affected secretion of two proteins: placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) and endostatin. METHODS: A series of modifications in the basic and/or hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide were made by polymerase chain reaction with endostatin or AP plasmids as templates. Transfection of wild-type or modified IL-2 signal peptides fused in-frame with endostatin or AP were done with Superfect in vitro or by the hydrodynamic method in vivo. RESULTS: Increasing both the basicity and hydrophobicity of the signal peptide augmented the secretion of AP and endostatin by approximately 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively, from MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro. Over a range of DNA concentrations and times, the most effective IL-2 signal peptide increased AP levels in the medium compared to the wild-type IL-2 signal peptide. Comparable results from these modified IL-2 signal peptides were found to increase AP levels in the medium from bovine aortic endothelial cells. Moreover, the combined changes in basic and hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide augmented serum levels of endostatin and placental AP by 3-fold when the optimal plasmid constructs were injected in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Modification of the IL-2 signal peptide augments protein secretion both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, optimizing the signal peptide should be considered for increasing the therapeutic levels of secreted proteins.},

	title = {Prediction of {Signal} {Peptide} {Cleavage} {Sites} with {Subsite}-{Coupled} and {Template} {Matching} {Fusion} {Algorithm}},
	volume = {33},
	abstract = {Fast and effective prediction of signal peptides (SP) and their cleavage sites is of great importance in computational biology. The approaches developed to predict signal peptide can be roughly divided into machine learning based, and sliding windows based. In order to further increase the prediction accuracy and coverage of organism for SP cleavage sites, we propose a novel method for predicting SP cleavage sites called Signal-CTF that utilizes machine learning and sliding windows, and is designed for N-termial secretory proteins in a large variety of organisms including human, animal, plant, virus, bacteria, fungi and archaea. Signal-CTF consists of three distinct elements: (1) a subsite-coupled and regularization function with a scaled window of fixed width that selects a set of candidates of possible secretion-cleavable segment for a query secretory protein; (2) a sum fusion system that integrates the outcomes from aligning the cleavage site template sequence with each of the aforementioned candidates in a scaled window of fixed width to determine the best candidate cleavage sites for the query secretory protein; (3) a voting system that identifies the ultimate signal peptide cleavage site among all possible results derived from using scaled windows of different width. When compared with Signal-3L and SignalP 4.0 predictors, the prediction accuracy of Signal-CTF is 4–12 \%, 10–25 \% higher than that of Signal-3L for human, animal and eukaryote, and SignalP 4.0 for eukaryota, Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Comparing with PRED-SIGNAL and SignalP 4.0 predictors on the 32 archaea secretory proteins of used in Bagos’s paper, the prediction accuracy of Signal-CTF is 12.5 \%, 25 \% higher than that of PRED-SIGNAL and SignalP 4.0, respectively. The predicting results of several long signal peptides show that the Signal-CTF can better predict cleavage sites for long signal peptides than SignalP, Phobius, Philius, SPOCTOPUS, Signal-CF and Signal-3L. These results show that Signal-CTF is more accurate and flexible in predicting signal peptides of different characteristics for many organisms.

	abstract = {A signal peptide is a short peptide chain that directs the transport of a protein and has become the crucial vehicle in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells for gene therapy. As the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the postgenomic era, the challenge of identifying new signal sequences has become even more urgent and critical in biomedical engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel predictor called Signal-BNF to predict the N-terminal signal peptide as well as its cleavage site based on Bayesian reasoning network. Signal-BNF is formed by fusing the results of different Bayesian classifiers which used different feature datasets as its input through weighted voting system. Experiment results show that Signal-BNF is superior to the popular online predictors such as Signal-3L and PrediSi. Signal-BNF is featured by high prediction accuracy that may serve as a useful tool for further investigating many unclear details regarding the molecular mechanism of the zip code protein-sorting system in cells.},

	volume = {52},
	abstract = {Human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (hHint1) is a member of a ubiquitous and ancient branch of the histidine triad protein superfamily. hHint1 is a homodimeric protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of model substrates, phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate, with a high efficiency. Recently, catalytically inactive hHint1 has been identified as the cause of inherited peripheral neuropathy [Zimon, M., et al. (2012) Nat. Genet. 44, 1080-1083]. We have conducted the first detailed kinetic mechanistic studies of hHint1 and have found that the reaction mechanism is consistent with a double-displacement mechanism, in which the active site nucleophile His112 is first adenylylated by the substrate, followed by hydrolysis of the AMP-enzyme intermediate. A transient burst phase followed by a linear phase from the stopped-flow fluorescence assay indicated that enzyme adenylylation was faster than the subsequent intermediate hydrolysis and product release. Solvent viscosity experiments suggested that both chemical transformation and diffusion-sensitive events (product release or protein conformational change) limit the overall turnover. The catalytic trapping experiments and data simulation indicated that the true koff rate of the final product AMP is unlikely to control the overall kcat. Therefore, a protein conformational change associated with product release is likely rate-limiting. In addition, the rate of Hint1 adenylylation was found to be dependent on two residues with pKa values of 6.5 and 8, with the former pKa agreeing well with the nuclear magnetic resonance titration results for the pKa of the active site nucleophile His112. In comparison to the uncatalyzed rates, hHint1 was shown to enhance acyl-AMP and AMP phosphoramidate hydrolysis by 10(6)-10(8)-fold. Taken together, our analysis indicates that hHint1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate with high efficiency, through a mechanism that relies on rapid adenylylation of the active residue, His112, while being partially rate-limited by intermediate hydrolysis and product release associated with a conformational change. Given the high degree of sequence homology of Hint proteins across all kingdoms of life, it is likely that their kinetic and catalytic mechanisms will be similar to those elucidated for hHint1.},

	volume = {180},
	abstract = {The gene responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) has been recently identified to code for a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase, BTK), required for normal B cell development. BTK, like many other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, contains Src homology domains (SH2 and SH3), and catalytic kinase domain. SH3 domains are important for the targeting of signaling molecules to specific subcellular locations. We have identified a family with XLA whose affected members have a point mutation (g–{\textgreater}a) at the 5' splice site of intron 8, resulting in the skipping of coding exon 8 and loss of 21 amino acids forming the COOH-terminal portion of the BTK SH3 domain. The study of three generations within this kinship, using restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA analysis, allowed identification of the mutant X chromosome responsible for XLA and the carrier status in this family. BTK mRNA was present in normal amounts in Epstein-Barr virus-induced B lymphoblastoid cell lines established from affected family members. Although the SH3 deletion did not alter BTK protein stability and kinase activity of the truncated BTK protein was normal, the affected patients nevertheless have a severe B cell defect characteristic for XLA. The mutant protein was modeled using the normal BTK SH3 domain. The deletion results in loss of two COOH-terminal beta strands containing several residues critical for the formation of the putative SH3 ligand-binding pocket. We predict that, as a result, one or more crucial SH3 binding proteins fail to interact with BTK, interrupting the cytoplasmic signal transduction process required for B cell differentiation.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-7-178},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction has been improving steadily towards the 88\% estimated theoretical limit. There are two types of prediction algorithms: Single-sequence prediction algorithms imply that information about other (homologous) proteins is not available, while algorithms of the second type imply that information about homologous proteins is available, and use it intensively. The single-sequence algorithms could make an important contribution to studies of proteins with no detected homologs, however the accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction from a single-sequence is not as high as when the additional evolutionary information is present.RESULTS:In this paper, we further refine and extend the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) initially considered in the BSPSS algorithm. We introduce an improved residue dependency model by considering the patterns of statistically significant amino acid correlation at structural segment borders. We also derive models that specialize on different sections of the dependency structure and incorporate them into HSMM. In addition, we implement an iterative training method to refine estimates of HSMM parameters. The three-state-per-residue accuracy and other accuracy measures of the new method, IPSSP, are shown to be comparable or better than ones for BSPSS as well as for PSIPRED, tested under the single-sequence condition.CONCLUSIONS:We have shown that new dependency models and training methods bring further improvements to single-sequence protein secondary structure prediction. The results are obtained under cross-validation conditions using a dataset with no pair of sequences having significant sequence similarity. As new sequences are added to the database it is possible to augment the dependency structure and obtain even higher accuracy. Current and future advances should contribute to the improvement of function prediction for orphan proteins inscrutable to current similarity search methods.},

	abstract = {Reduced or simplified amino acid alphabets group the 20 naturally occurring amino acids into a smaller number of representative protein residues. To date, several reduced amino acid alphabets have been proposed, which have been derived and optimized by a variety of methods. The resulting reduced amino acid alphabets have been applied to pattern recognition, generation of consensus sequences from multiple alignments, protein folding, and protein structure prediction. In this work, amino acid substitution matrices and statistical potentials were derived based on several reduced amino acid alphabets and their performance assessed in a large benchmark for the tasks of sequence alignment and fold assessment of protein structure models, using as a reference frame the standard alphabet of 20 amino acids. The results showed that a large reduction in the total number of residue types does not necessarily translate into a significant loss of discriminative power for sequence alignment and fold assessment. Therefore, some definitions of a few residue types are able to encode most of the relevant sequence/structure information that is present in the 20 standard amino acids. Based on these results, we suggest that the use of reduced amino acid alphabets may allow to increasing the accuracy of current substitution matrices and statistical potentials for the prediction of protein structure of remote homologs.},
